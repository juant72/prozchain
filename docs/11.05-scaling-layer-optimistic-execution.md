# Optimistic Execution

## Overview

Optimistic execution is a scaling technique that allows ProzChain to process transactions off-chain while maintaining the security guarantees of the main chain. Unlike traditional blockchain systems that validate every transaction before confirmation, optimistic execution assumes transactions are valid by default and only performs full verification if disputed. This approach significantly increases throughput, reduces latency, and decreases costs while preserving the security and decentralization of the network.

This document explores how ProzChain implements optimistic execution as part of its scaling layer, focusing on its technical architecture, fraud proof system, and integration with other scaling solutions.

## Core Concepts

### The Optimistic Principle

Optimistic execution is based on three key principles:

1. **Assume Valid**: Transactions and state transitions are considered valid by default
2. **Economic Security**: Validators provide bonds that can be slashed if they submit invalid data
3. **Challenge Window**: A time period during which anyone can challenge invalid transactions
4. **Fraud Proofs**: Cryptographic proofs that demonstrate invalid state transitions

### Types of Optimistic Systems

ProzChain implements optimistic execution in several forms:

1. **Optimistic Rollups**: Layer 2 scaling solution that batches transactions off-chain
2. **Optimistic Sharding**: Cross-shard transactions with optimistic verification
3. **Optimistic Virtual Machine (OVM)**: Specialized execution environment for optimistic computations
4. **Dispute Resolution Layer**: Protocol for efficiently resolving challenged transactions

## Optimistic Rollups

### Architecture

ProzChain's optimistic rollup implementation consists of the following components:

                           ▼

```

### Key Components

1. **Sequencer**:
   - Orders and executes user transactions
   - Provides quick pre-confirmations
   - Builds transaction batches
   - Submits batch data to Layer 1

2. **Aggregator**:
   - Computes state transitions
   - Creates state commitments
   - Submits state roots to Layer 1
   - Monitors for challenges

3. **Prover**:
   - Generates fraud proofs for invalid transactions
   - Verifies state transition correctness
   - Submits proofs during disputes
   - Maintains necessary state data

4. **Data Availability Layer**:
   - Stores transaction data needed for verification
   - Makes data accessible to all network participants
   - Ensures anyone can reconstruct state if needed
   - Implements various compression techniques

5. **Verification Contracts**:
   - Manage the optimistic verification protocol
   - Process stake deposits and withdrawals
   - Handle fraud proof verification
   - Enforce dispute resolution rules

### Transaction Flow

The journey of a transaction through the optimistic rollup system:

1. **Submission**:
   - User submits transaction to sequencer
   - Transaction is validated for basic correctness
   - User receives acknowledgment

2. **Batch Creation**:
   - Sequencer orders multiple transactions into batch
   - Batch is executed to compute new state
   - State transition is recorded

3. **Layer 1 Submission**:
   - Batch data posted to Layer 1 as calldata
   - State root committed to verification contract
   - Aggregator bond is staked against correctness

4. **Challenge Period**:
   - One-week window for fraud proof submission
   - Any validator can challenge by submitting proof
   - Proofs verified by on-chain contracts

5. **Finalization**:
   - If no successful challenges, state is finalized
   - Assets can be withdrawn to Layer 1
   - State becomes permanent part of history

### Optimistic Rollup Smart Contracts

The primary contracts that enable optimistic rollups:

```solidity
// Simplified StateCommitmentChain contract
contract StateCommitmentChain {
    mapping(uint256 => bytes32) public stateRoots;
    mapping(bytes32 => bool) public finalized;
    uint256 public latestBlockNumber;
    uint256 public challengePeriod = 7 days;
    
    struct Commitment {
        bytes32 stateRoot;
        uint256 timestamp;
        address aggregator;
        bool challenged;
    }
    
    mapping(uint256 => Commitment) public commitments;
    
    // Submit a new state root
    function submitStateRoot(
        bytes32 _stateRoot,
        uint256 _blockNumber
    ) external payable {
        require(_blockNumber == latestBlockNumber + 1, "Invalid block number");
        require(msg.value >= minBond(), "Insufficient bond");
        
        commitments[_blockNumber] = Commitment({
            stateRoot: _stateRoot,
            timestamp: block.timestamp,
            aggregator: msg.sender,
            challenged: false
        });
        
        stateRoots[_blockNumber] = _stateRoot;
        latestBlockNumber = _blockNumber;
        
        emit StateBatchAppended(_blockNumber, _stateRoot, msg.sender);
    }
    
    // Finalize a state root after challenge period
    function finalizeStateRoot(uint256 _blockNumber) external {
        Commitment storage commitment = commitments[_blockNumber];
        require(commitment.stateRoot != bytes32(0), "Commitment does not exist");
        require(!commitment.challenged, "Commitment was challenged");
        require(
            block.timestamp >= commitment.timestamp + challengePeriod,
            "Challenge period not over"
        );
        
        finalized[commitment.stateRoot] = true;
        
        emit StateRootFinalized(_blockNumber, commitment.stateRoot);
    }
    
    // Challenge an invalid state root
    function challengeStateRoot(
        uint256 _blockNumber,
        bytes calldata _fraudProof
    ) external {
        // Challenge verification logic
        // If successful, slash aggregator and update state
    }
}
```

## Fraud Proof System

### Fraud Proof Architecture

The fraud proof system enables the verification of invalid state transitions:

1. **Types of Fraud Proofs**:
   - **Transaction Execution Proof**: Demonstrates incorrect transaction execution
   - **State Transition Proof**: Shows invalid state update
   - **Data Availability Proof**: Proves data was withheld
   - **Input Data Proof**: Demonstrates input data was corrupted

2. **Interactive Verification**:
   - Fraud proofs use binary search to narrow down exact point of disagreement
   - Reduces verification complexity from O(n) to O(log n)
   - Makes on-chain verification efficient and gas-friendly

3. **Proof Structure**:
   - Pre-state root
   - Transaction or state transition data
   - Post-state root
   - Witness data (execution trace, merkle proofs)
   - Challenge point identifier

### Binary Search for Disputes

The binary search process for pinpointing errors:

1. Challenger claims state transition S₁ → S₂ is invalid
2. Challenger and defender agree on intermediate states at midpoint
3. Process recursively narrows to single instruction where disagreement occurs
4. Final step executes single disputed instruction on-chain
5. Result determines winner of challenge

```
Initial State (S₁) ───────────────────────▶ Final State (S₂)
                    Many steps (n)
                    
                          ┌───────────────────┐
                          │  Binary Search    │
                          ▼                   ▼
            
S₁ ──────────────▶ S_mid ─────────────────▶ S₂
   n/2 steps          n/2 steps
   
                   Repeat until single step
                   
S_i ──────▶ S_i+1
  1 step (execute on-chain)
```

### Verification Game Protocol

The protocol for interactive fraud proof verification:

1. **Initiation Phase**:
   - Challenger submits bond and dispute details
   - Defender notified of challenge against their state claim
   - Both parties commit security deposits

2. **Bisection Phase**:
   - Parties iteratively bisect execution trace
   - Each round narrows dispute to smaller section
   - Continues until single instruction identified

3. **On-Chain Verification**:
   - Single disputed instruction executed on-chain
   - Minimal computation performed in verification contract
   - Result compared against claimed outputs

4. **Resolution Phase**:
   - Winning party receives portion of losing party's deposit
   - If fraud proven, state transition is rejected
   - New correct state transition can be proposed

### Optimizations

Several techniques make fraud proofs more efficient:

1. **Parallelizable Verification**:
   - Multiple disputes can proceed independently
   - Verification steps executed in parallel
   - Reduces bottlenecks in dispute resolution

2. **Lazy Evaluation**:
   - State accessed only when specifically required
   - Avoids loading entire state for verification
   - Optimized Merkle proof generation

3. **Circuit Compilation**:
   - Complex verification logic compiled to efficient circuits
   - Reduces on-chain gas costs
   - Shared verification libraries for common operations

## Optimistic Virtual Machine (OVM)

│                │         │                │
│    Shard A     │         │    Shard B     │

        │    Commitment             │    Relay
        │                           │
        ▼                           ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                             │

│                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Transaction Flow

Cross-shard optimistic transactions follow this flow:

1. **Source Shard Execution**:
   - Transaction executes in source shard
   - Cross-shard message is generated
   - State locked in source shard

2. **Optimistic Relay**:
   - Message passed to destination shard
   - Execution assumed valid

3. **Destination Execution**:
   - Destination shard processes message
   - Optimistically updates state
   - Creates receipt of execution

4. **Finality Period**:
   - One-day challenge window opens
   - Any validator can challenge execution
   - If unchallenged, becomes final

5. **Challenge Mechanism**:
   - Similar to rollup fraud proofs
   - Binary search identifies error
   - On-chain verification of disputed step

## Economic Model

### Bonding and Security

Optimistic execution requires economic security:

1. **Security Bonds**:
   - Aggregators post bonds when submitting state
   - Bond sizes scale with economic value at stake
   - Bonds are slashed if fraud is proven
   - Bond held until challenge period expires

2. **Challenge Rewards**:
   - Successful challengers receive reward from bond
   - Reward must exceed verification costs
   - Sliding scale based on fraud severity
   - Additional protocol rewards for security

3. **Economic Equilibrium**:
   - Bond > (Profit from Fraud + Chance of Success)
   - Reward > Cost of Generating Proof
   - Optimistic execution remains secure when these inequalities hold

### Fee Structure

The fee model balances costs across layers:

1. **Layer 1 Data Costs**:
   - Calldata publication fees
   - Verification contract interactions
   - Challenge submission costs

2. **Layer 2 Execution Fees**:
   - Transaction execution costs
   - State storage fees
   - Priority fees for sequencing

3. **Fee Distribution**:
   - Sequencer receives portion of L2 fees
   - Protocol treasury for security fund
   - Data availability providers compensated

## Optimistic Data Availability

### Optimistic DA Model

ProzChain implements an optimistic data availability model:

1. **Minimal On-Chain Data**:
   - Only state commitments posted on-chain
   - Full data stored off-chain
   - Data availability attestations from validators

2. **Availability Challenges**:
   - Anyone can challenge data unavailability
   - Random sampling to verify data exists
   - Challenge requires data to be produced

3. **Data Recovery**:
   - Erasure coding for data reconstruction
   - Distributed storage across validator network
   - Incentives for data retention and provision

### Optimistic Light Clients

Light clients leverage optimistic assumptions:

1. **Header Verification**:
   - Verify block headers only
   - Assume data is available
   - Trust but verify model

2. **Fraud Proof Verification**:
   - If fraud proof received, verify it
   - Revert to previous valid state if fraud confirmed
   - Minimal computational requirements

3. **Security Model**:
   - Assumes at least one honest validator
   - Economic incentives for correct behavior
   - Fast verification with minimal resources

## Conclusion

Optimistic execution represents a powerful approach to blockchain scaling in ProzChain. By assuming validity by default and providing mechanisms to challenge invalid state transitions, the system achieves high throughput and cost efficiency while maintaining security guarantees. The optimistic models implemented across rollups, shards, and specialized VMs provide developers with flexible options for building scalable applications.

As research continues and implementations mature, optimistic execution will continue to play a central role in ProzChain's scaling strategy, complementing other approaches such as sharding and zero-knowledge proofs in the comprehensive scaling layer.
