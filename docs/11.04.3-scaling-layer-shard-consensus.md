# Shard Consensus

## Overview

Shard consensus is the mechanism by which validators within a single shard reach agreement on the state of that shard. In ProzChain's sharded architecture, each shard operates its own consensus protocol while still coordinating with the beacon chain for cross-shard operations and global finality.

This document describes the consensus mechanisms used within individual shards, how they integrate with the broader ProzChain consensus system, and the security considerations for maintaining consensus in a sharded environment.

## Consensus Design Goals

The shard consensus mechanism in ProzChain is designed to achieve the following goals:

1. **High Throughput**: Process many transactions per second within each shard
2. **Low Latency**: Minimize block time and transaction confirmation delays
3. **Strong Security**: Maintain Byzantine fault tolerance against validator attacks
4. **Decentralization**: Allow broad participation while maintaining efficiency
5. **Finality**: Provide definite transaction outcomes without lengthy confirmations
6. **Compatibility**: Support cross-shard operations with minimal overhead
7. **Resource Efficiency**: Operate with reasonable hardware requirements

## Consensus Architecture

### Overall Structure

The consensus architecture consists of multiple layers working together:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                      Global Consensus                       │
│                       (Beacon Chain)                        │
└───────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────┘
                            │
            ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
            │               │               │
┌───────────▼───────┐ ┌─────▼───────┐ ┌─────▼───────┐
│  Shard Consensus  │ │Shard Consensus│ │Shard Consensus│
│     (Shard 1)     │ │  (Shard 2)   │ │  (Shard N)   │
└───────────────────┘ └─────────────┘ └─────────────┘
```

### Committee-Based Byzantine Fault Tolerance

Each shard uses a committee-based Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocol:

1. **Validator Committee**: Each shard has a dedicated committee of validators
2. **Leader Selection**: Per-round leader selected via deterministic algorithm
3. **Block Proposal**: Leader proposes blocks with transactions and state transitions
4. **Voting Process**: Committee members validate and vote on proposed blocks
5. **Finality**: Block is finalized when sufficient votes are received
6. **Rotation**: Committees change periodically to prevent attacks

## Shard Consensus Protocol

### ProzBFT Protocol

ProzChain shards use ProzBFT, a BFT consensus protocol optimized for sharded environments:

```

#### Protocol Phases

1. **Leader Selection Phase**:
   - Round leader selected based on deterministic algorithm
   - Selection uses verifiable random function (VRF) seeded by beacon chain
   - Selection probability proportional to validator stake

2. **Block Proposal Phase**:
   - Leader constructs a new block with pending transactions
   - Block includes parent hash, timestamp, transactions, state root
   - Leader signs the block and broadcasts to committee

3. **Block Validation Phase**:
   - Committee members validate block contents
   - Check parent hash, timestamp, and transaction validity
   - Verify state transitions and execution results
   - Malformed blocks are rejected immediately

4. **Pre-Vote Phase**:
   - Validators broadcast pre-votes for valid blocks
   - Pre-vote includes validator signature and block hash
   - Requires network communication between committee members

5. **Pre-Commit Phase**:
   - Upon receiving 2/3+ pre-votes, validators send pre-commit
   - Pre-commit signals readiness to finalize the block
   - Aggregated pre-commits form block certificate

6. **Finalization Phase**:
   - Block with 2/3+ pre-commits becomes finalized
   - Finalized blocks cannot be reverted within shard
   - Finalization information communicated to beacon chain
   - Finality status updated in shard state

7. **Block Execution Phase**:
   - Transactions in finalized block are executed
   - State transitions are applied to shard state
   - Receipts and events are generated
   - Cross-shard messages are queued for transmission

### Consensus Optimizations

ProzChain implements several optimizations to improve consensus performance:

1. **Signature Aggregation**:
   - BLS signature aggregation reduces communication overhead
   - Multiple validator signatures combined into single verification
   - Reduces network bandwidth requirements dramatically
   - Improves block processing speed

2. **Pipelined Block Production**:
   - Next block proposal starts before current block finalization
   - Overlapping phases improve throughput
   - Reduces idle time between blocks
   - Can improve throughput by 30-50%

3. **Hierarchical Validation**:
   - Transactions are pre-validated in parallel
   - Block structure validated before full state validation
   - Progressive commitment to block content
   - Allows early detection of invalid blocks

4. **Adaptive Timeout Management**:
   - Dynamic timeouts based on network conditions
   - Aggressive timeouts during normal operation
   - Extended timeouts during network congestion
   - Self-tuning based on observed performance

## Integration with Beacon Chain

### Crosslink Mechanism

ProzChain uses crosslinks to connect shard consensus with global consensus:

1. **Crosslink Structure**:
   - Contains shard identifier
   - Block hash of finalized shard block
   - Aggregated signatures from shard validators
   - Timestamp and checkpoint information
   - Merkle root of shard state

2. **Crosslink Submission**:
   - Generated every N blocks (e.g., every 4 shard blocks)
   - Submitted to beacon chain by designated validator
   - Requires 2/3+ committee signatures to be valid
   - Serves as checkpoint for shard state

3. **Crosslink Verification**:
   - Beacon chain validates committee signatures
   - Verifies that signers are legitimate committee members
   - Checks that submitted block follows previous checkpoint
   - Ensures consistent view of shard state

4. **Finality Confirmation**:
   - Beacon chain consensus on crosslink confirms global finality
   - Provides security guarantees for cross-shard operations
   - Enables roll-up of security to main chain
   - Allows light clients to trust shard state transitions

### Example Crosslink Data Structure

```json
{
  "shardId": 3,
  "epoch": 1427,
  "blockRoot": "0x7abc4d23...",
  "stateRoot": "0x8def1234...",
  "parentCrosslinkRoot": "0x5678abcd...",
  "slot": 45664,
  "committeeSignatures": {
    "bitfield": "0xffae12...", // Which validators signed
    "aggregateSignature": "0x12345678..."
  }
}
```

### Validator Committee Selection

Validator committees are selected using a beacon chain-derived randomness:

1. **Randomness Source**:
   - RANDAO-based randomness from beacon chain
   - Each epoch generates new random seed
   - Seed used to deterministically select committees
   - Unpredictable before epoch boundary

2. **Selection Algorithm**:
   - Random shuffling of all active validators
   - Equal-sized committees assigned to each shard
   - Minimum committee size enforced for security
   - Committee overlap between epochs for smooth transition

3. **Rotation Schedule**:
   - Committees rotate every epoch (e.g., 24 hours)
   - Rotation frequency tuned to balance security and overhead
   - Partial overlap between successive committees
   - Emergency rotation possible in case of attacks

4. **Example Committee Selection Code**:

```python
def select_committees(validators, num_shards, seed):
    """Select validator committees for each shard."""
    shuffled = shuffle_validators(validators, seed)
    committee_size = len(shuffled) // num_shards
    
    # Ensure minimum committee size
    assert committee_size >= MIN_COMMITTEE_SIZE, "Insufficient validators"
    
    committees = []
    for i in range(num_shards):
        start_idx = i * committee_size
        end_idx = (i + 1) * committee_size
        committees.append(shuffled[start_idx:end_idx])
    
    return committees
```

## Fault Tolerance and Security

### Byzantine Fault Tolerance

ProzChain's shard consensus provides Byzantine fault tolerance with the following properties:

1. **Security Threshold**:
   - Tolerates up to f Byzantine validators where f < n/3
   - Requires 2/3+ honest validators for security
   - Shard committee sized to ensure security margin
   - Security analysis accounts for sampling risk

2. **Consistency Guarantee**:
   - No conflicting blocks can be finalized
   - All honest validators agree on finalized blocks
   - State transitions are deterministic
   - Finalized blocks form a linear chain

3. **Liveness Guarantee**:
   - Progress made when network is synchronous
   - Transactions eventually included in blocks
   - View change mechanism handles leader failures
   - Backup proposal mechanism for unresponsive leaders

### Security Considerations in Sharded Context

Special security considerations for consensus in sharded environments:

1. **Randomness Security**:
   - Unbiasable committee selection is critical
   - Randomness must be unpredictable before revealed
   - Commitment schemes prevent manipulation
   - VRF-based leader selection prevents pre-computation

2. **Adaptive Adversary Protection**:
   - Frequent committee rotation prevents targeted attacks
   - Unpredictable committee selection
   - Validator identity separate from network identity
   - Anti-correlation measures in committee selection

3. **Shard Takeover Defense**:
   - Minimum committee size prevents easy capture
   - Random committee selection prevents concentration
   - Cross-shard verification of suspicious activity
   - Economic penalties for dishonest behavior

4. **Long-Range Attack Protection**:
   - Finality guarantees prevent chain reorgs
   - Weak subjectivity checkpoints
   - Social consensus on checkpoint validity
   - Time-bound signature validation

### Economic Security

Economic incentives reinforce protocol security:

1. **Staking Requirements**:
   - Validators must stake significant capital
   - Stake locked during validation period
   - Economic cost to attack system scales with security
   - Minimum stake requirement adjusts with token value

2. **Slashing Conditions**:
   - Equivocation (double signing) results in slashing
   - Provable misbehavior heavily penalized
   - Inactivity penalties for offline validators
   - Graduated penalty scale based on severity

3. **Reward Mechanisms**:
   - Block proposal rewards for leaders
   - Attestation rewards for committee members
   - Fee distribution to incentivize participation
   - Extra rewards for crosslink inclusion

## Consensus Parameters

Key parameters that control shard consensus behavior:

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Committee Size | 128 validators | Number of validators per shard |
| Fault Tolerance | 42 (1/3 of committee) | Maximum Byzantine validators tolerated |
| Block Time | 2 seconds | Target time between blocks |
| Voting Timeout | 1 second | Maximum time for vote collection |
| Epochs Per Rotation | 1 | Epochs before committee rotation |

| Maximum Block Size | 5 MB | Maximum size of proposed blocks |

## Protocol Deep Dive

### Detailed Message Flow

The precise message flow in the ProzBFT consensus:

1. **PrepareBlock Message**:
   - Sent by round leader to committee members
   - Contains proposed block data
   - Includes leader signature
   - Has highest network priority

2. **PreVote Message**:
   - Sent by committee members after validation
   - Contains block hash and height
   - Includes validator signature
   - Broadcast to all committee members

3. **PreCommit Message**:
   - Sent after observing sufficient PreVotes
   - Contains commitment to block hash
   - Includes validator signature
   - Broadcast to all committee members

4. **FinalityProof Message**:
   - Aggregated signatures of PreCommits
   - Forms certificate of finality
   - Includes participating validator bitmap
   - Used for crosslink creation

### Leader Selection Algorithm

Deterministic but unpredictable leader selection:

```python
def select_leader(validators, round_number, seed):
    """Select leader for given round deterministically but unpredictably."""
    # Combine round number with seed for round-specific selection
    round_seed = hash(seed + round_number.to_bytes(8, 'big'))
    
    # Convert seed to integer in range [0, sum_of_all_stakes)
    stake_sum = sum(v.effective_stake for v in validators)
    target = int.from_bytes(round_seed, 'big') % stake_sum
    
    # Select validator based on weighted stake
    cumulative_stake = 0
    for validator in validators:
        cumulative_stake += validator.effective_stake
        if cumulative_stake > target:
            return validator
```

### View Change Protocol

ProzBFT includes a view change mechanism to handle leader failures:

1. **Timeout Detection**:
   - Each validator maintains proposal timer
   - If no valid proposal received within timeout, trigger view change
   - Timeout adjusted based on network conditions
   - Extended timeout for first round after rotation

2. **View Change Initiation**:
   - Validator broadcasts ViewChange message
   - Message includes current view and last finalized block
   - Signed by validator to prevent spoofing
   - Includes proof of timeout

3. **View Change Quorum**:
   - View change requires 2/3+ ViewChange messages
   - New leader selected deterministically for next view
   - All view change messages collected as proof
   - Prevents conflicting view changes

4. **New View Establishment**:
   - New leader broadcasts NewView message
   - Includes proof of sufficient ViewChange messages
   - Resets protocol to proposal phase
   - May include new block proposal immediately

### Block Format and Validation

Each shard block contains:

```json
{
  "header": {
    "shardId": 3,
    "blockNumber": 12345,
    "viewNumber": 5,
    "parentHash": "0xabc123...",
    "stateRoot": "0xdef456...",
    "transactionsRoot": "0x789abc...",
    "receiptsRoot": "0x012def...",
    "timestamp": 1636472735,
    "leaderSignature": "0xfedcba..."
  },
  "body": {
    "transactions": [
      "0xtx1...", "0xtx2...", "..."
    ],
    "crossShardPayloads": {
      "outgoing": ["0xmsg1...", "0xmsg2...", "..."],
      "processed": ["0xpmsg1...", "0xpmsg2...", "..."]
    }
  },
  "consensus": {
    "preVotes": ["0xsig1...", "0xsig2...", "..."],
    "preCommits": ["0xsig1...", "0xsig2...", "..."],
    "finalityProof": "0xproof..."
  }
}
```

Block validation includes:

1. **Structural Validation**:
   - Format correctness
   - Required fields presence
   - Size limits enforcement

2. **Cryptographic Validation**:
   - Leader signature verification
   - Parent hash verification
   - Transaction signature checks

3. **Consensus Rule Validation**:
   - Block time within acceptable range
   - Leader is legitimate for current view
   - Block follows consensus protocol rules

4. **State Transition Validation**:
   - Transaction execution validity
   - State transitions correctness
   - Resulting state root verification
