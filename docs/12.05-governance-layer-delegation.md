# Delegation System

## Overview

ProzChain's delegation system allows token holders to transfer their governance voting power to other addresses without transferring the underlying tokens. This mechanism enhances governance participation by enabling those who lack time, expertise, or interest to empower trusted representatives to vote on their behalf. Effective delegation is crucial for maintaining high governance participation while ensuring governance decisions are informed by appropriate expertise.

This document explains ProzChain's delegation system in detail, including its design, implementation, best practices, and security considerations. Understanding these aspects is essential for both token holders looking to delegate and those seeking to become delegates.

## Core Delegation Framework

### Fundamental Principles

ProzChain's delegation system is built on these core principles:

1. **Voluntary Participation**: Delegation is always optional and revocable
2. **Voting Power Transfer**: Delegates receive voting power but not ownership of tokens
3. **Transparency**: All delegation relationships are publicly visible
4. **Flexibility**: Delegation can be full or partial, general or domain-specific
5. **Accountability**: Performance metrics help evaluate delegate effectiveness
6. **Revocability**: Delegations can be changed or revoked at any time
7. **Depth Limitation**: Delegation chains are limited to prevent centralization

### Delegation Types

ProzChain supports multiple delegation models to meet diverse needs:

1. **Full Delegation**:
   - Transfer all voting power across all proposal types
   - Simplest form of delegation
   - Suitable for passive token holders
   - Single action delegates all governance rights

2. **Domain-Specific Delegation**:
   - Separate delegates for different proposal categories
   - Technical delegates for protocol upgrades
   - Financial delegates for treasury decisions
   - Governance delegates for meta-governance issues
   - Allows specialization based on expertise

3. **Partial Delegation**:
   - Delegate a percentage of voting power
   - Retain partial voting rights
   - Spread delegation across multiple delegates
   - Fine-grained control over influence distribution

4. **Time-Bounded Delegation**:
   - Delegation with automatic expiration
   - Set duration for delegation period
   - Useful for temporary absence
   - Requires less active management

### Core Functions

Key functions in the delegation system:

```solidity
// Simplified delegation function
function delegate(
    address delegatee,
    uint256 domainId,
    uint256 percentage
) external {
    require(delegatee != msg.sender, "Cannot delegate to self");
    require(percentage <= MAX_PERCENTAGE, "Invalid percentage");
    require(!_wouldCreateLoop(msg.sender, delegatee, domainId), "Would create delegation loop");
    
    // Update existing delegation
    address currentDelegatee = delegations[msg.sender][domainId].delegatee;
    uint256 currentPercentage = delegations[msg.sender][domainId].percentage;
    
    if (currentDelegatee != address(0)) {
        delegatedPower[currentDelegatee][domainId] -= 
            (balanceOf(msg.sender) * currentPercentage) / MAX_PERCENTAGE;
    }
    
    // Set new delegation
    delegations[msg.sender][domainId] = Delegation({
        delegatee: delegatee,
        percentage: percentage,
        timestamp: block.timestamp,
        domainId: domainId
    });
    
    // Update delegate's power
    if (delegatee != address(0) && percentage > 0) {
        delegatedPower[delegatee][domainId] += 
            (balanceOf(msg.sender) * percentage) / MAX_PERCENTAGE;
    }
    
    emit PowerDelegated(msg.sender, delegatee, domainId, percentage);
}

// Calculate actual voting power including delegations
function getVotingPower(address account, uint256 domainId) public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 ownPower = balanceOf(account);
    
    // Subtract delegated power
    Delegation memory delegation = delegations[account][domainId];
    if (delegation.delegatee != address(0)) {
        ownPower = ownPower - (ownPower * delegation.percentage) / MAX_PERCENTAGE;
    }
    
    // Add received delegations
    ownPower += delegatedPower[account][domainId];
    
    return ownPower;
}

// Check for delegation loops (simplified)
function _wouldCreateLoop(
    address delegator,
    address targetDelegatee,
    uint256 domainId
) internal view returns (bool) {
    address current = targetDelegatee;
    uint256 depth = 0;
    uint256 maxDepth = 4; // Maximum delegation chain length
    
    while (current != address(0) && depth < maxDepth) {
        // If we find the original delegator in the chain, this would create a loop
        if (current == delegator) {
            return true;
        }
        
        // Move to the next delegatee in the chain
        current = delegations[current][domainId].delegatee;
        depth++;
    }
    
    return false;
}
```

### Delegation Events

Key events emitted by the delegation contracts:

```solidity
// Emitted when a delegation is created or updated
event PowerDelegated(
    address indexed delegator,
    address indexed delegatee,
    uint256 indexed domainId,
    uint256 percentage
);

// Emitted when a delegation is removed
event DelegationRemoved(
    address indexed delegator,
    address indexed previousDelegatee,
    uint256 indexed domainId
);

// Emitted when voting on behalf of delegators
event VoteByDelegate(
    address indexed delegate,
    uint256 indexed proposalId,
    uint8 support,
    uint256 votingPower,
    uint256 delegatorCount
);

// Emitted when a delegator overrides their delegate's vote
event DelegationOverride(
    address indexed delegator,
    address indexed delegate,
    uint256 indexed proposalId,
    uint8 overriddenSupport,
    uint8 newSupport
);
```

### Storage Structures

Key data structures for delegation:

```solidity
// Delegation relationship information
struct Delegation {
    address delegatee;     // Address receiving delegation
    uint256 percentage;    // Percentage of voting power delegated (1e18 = 100%)
    uint256 timestamp;     // When the delegation was created/updated
    uint256 domainId;      // Domain of governance this applies to
}

// Delegate performance metrics
struct DelegateMetrics {
    uint256 proposalsVoted;       // Number of proposals the delegate voted on
    uint256 proposalsMissed;      // Number of proposals the delegate missed
    uint256 totalDelegatedPower;  // Current total delegated voting power
    uint256 delegatorCount;       // Number of delegators
    uint256 averageAlignment;     // Average vote alignment with delegators
}
```

## Delegation Mechanics

### Delegation Process

Step-by-step process of delegation:

1. **Selecting a Delegate**:
   - Research delegate candidates
   - Review delegate profiles and voting history
   - Assess alignment with personal governance preferences
   - Evaluate delegate performance metrics

2. **Configuring Delegation**:
   - Choose whether to delegate fully or partially
   - Decide on general delegation or domain-specific
   - Set any time limitations if desired
   - Configure override preferences

3. **Executing Delegation**:
   - Connect wallet to governance interface
   - Submit delegation transaction
   - Pay network transaction fee
   - Receive confirmation of delegation

4. **Managing Delegation**:
   - Monitor delegate voting activity
   - Review performance and alignment metrics
   - Adjust delegation parameters as needed
   - Revoke or change delegation if necessary

### Domain-Specific Delegation

Architecture for specialized delegation domains:

1. **Domain Categories**:
   - **Technical**: Protocol upgrades, parameter changes, technical implementations
   - **Economic**: Treasury, token economics, fee structures, incentive mechanisms
   - **Governance**: Meta-governance, process improvements, community management
   - **Security**: Emergency responses, vulnerability management, security upgrades
   - **Custom**: User-defined specialized domains

2. **Domain Configuration**:
   - Each domain has unique identifier
   - Domains can be enabled/disabled
   - Proposal types mapped to specific domains
   - Domain-specific delegation rules

3. **Implementation Approach**:
   - Registry contract manages domain definitions
   - Domain mapping for proposals
   - Domain-specific voting power calculation
   - Support for domain-specific delegation preferences

### Delegation Overrides

Mechanisms for delegators to override:

1. **Override Types**:
   - **Pre-vote Override**: Before delegate votes
   - **Post-vote Override**: After delegate votes
   - **Conditional Override**: Based on delegate's vote choice
   - **Emergency Override**: For critical proposals

2. **Implementation**:
   - Override tracking per delegator/proposal
   - Vote reconciliation mechanism
   - Priority system for conflicting votes
   - Transparent override recording

3. **Override Effect**:
   - Only affects specific proposal
   - Doesn't change ongoing delegation relationship
   - Can be applied selectively to proposals
   - Creates feedback signal for delegate

## Delegate Responsibilities and Incentives

   - Access to delegate-only forums

4. **Implementation Example**:

```solidity
// Simplified reward calculation (conceptual)
function calculateDelegateReward(address delegate) internal view returns (uint256) {
    DelegateMetrics memory metrics = delegateStats[delegate];
    
    // Base reward based on delegated power
    uint256 baseReward = metrics.totalDelegatedPower * BASE_REWARD_RATE;
    
    // Participation multiplier (1.0 = 100% participation)
    uint256 participation = metrics.proposalsVoted / 
        (metrics.proposalsVoted + metrics.proposalsMissed);
    
    // Apply participation bonus/penalty
    uint256 participationAdjustment = participation * PARTICIPATION_WEIGHT;
    
    // Apply longevity bonus
    uint256 longevityBonus = min(
        delegateSince[delegate] * LONGEVITY_RATE,
        MAX_LONGEVITY_BONUS
    );
    
    // Apply reputation factor
    uint256 reputationFactor = min(
        (metrics.averageAlignment * ALIGNMENT_WEIGHT) + 
        (metrics.delegatorCount * DELEGATOR_COUNT_WEIGHT),
        MAX_REPUTATION_FACTOR
    );
    
    return baseReward * 
        (BASE_FACTOR + participationAdjustment + longevityBonus) *
        reputationFactor / PRECISION_FACTOR;
}
```
