# Scaling Layer Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for key terminology related to blockchain scaling solutions used throughout the ProzChain documentation. Understanding these terms is essential for developers, researchers, and users working with ProzChain's scaling technologies.

## General Scaling Terminology

### Blockchain Scalability
The ability of a blockchain system to handle an increasing amount of transactions, users, and data while maintaining performance and decentralization.

### Scaling Trilemma
The concept that blockchain systems can only effectively achieve two out of three properties: decentralization, security, and scalability.

### Throughput
The rate at which a blockchain can process transactions, typically measured in transactions per second (TPS).

### Latency
The time delay between submitting a transaction and its confirmation or finality.

### Gas
Computational pricing mechanism used to allocate resources and prevent spam, typically paid in the network's native cryptocurrency.

### State Bloat
The continuous growth of blockchain state data that nodes must maintain, potentially degrading performance over time.

## Layer 1 Scaling

### Sharding
Partitioning the blockchain network into multiple segments (shards) that process transactions in parallel.

### Beacon Chain
A central coordination chain in sharded networks that manages validator assignments and cross-shard operations.

### Shard
An individual partition of the blockchain network with its own subset of validators and state.

### Cross-Shard Communication
Methods and protocols allowing transactions and data to move between different shards.

### Shard Committee
A group of validators assigned to process transactions and produce blocks for a specific shard.

### Crosslink
A reference on the beacon chain that records the state of a shard, allowing the network to track shard progression.

## Layer 2 Scaling

### Layer 2 (L2)
A secondary framework or protocol built on top of an existing blockchain (Layer 1) to improve scalability and efficiency.

### Off-Chain
Operations or data storage that occurs outside the main blockchain but can be verified or settled on the blockchain when necessary.

### State Channel
A two-party channel that enables participants to conduct multiple transactions off-chain with only the opening and closing transactions recorded on-chain.

### Payment Channel
A specific type of state channel optimized for rapid, low-cost payment transactions between parties.

### Channel Network
Interconnected payment or state channels that enable routing of transactions between parties that don't have a direct channel connection.

### Watchtower
A service that monitors state channels for potential malicious activity and broadcasts the latest state to the blockchain if necessary.

### Sidechain
A separate blockchain with its own consensus mechanism that is connected to the main chain (parent chain) via a two-way peg.

### Two-Way Peg
A mechanism allowing assets to move between a parent chain and sidechain, typically involving locking assets on one chain and minting representative tokens on the other.

### Plasma
A framework for creating child chains that process transactions in parallel and periodically commit to the main chain.

### Rollups
Layer 2 scaling solutions that "roll up" multiple transactions into a single proof or data submission to the main chain.

### Optimistic Rollups
Rollups that assume transactions are valid by default and rely on fraud proofs to challenge invalid transactions during a dispute period.

### ZK-Rollups
Rollups that use zero-knowledge proofs to cryptographically validate the correctness of transactions before submitting to the main chain.

### Validium
A variation of ZK-rollups where data availability is maintained off-chain, improving scalability at the cost of additional trust assumptions.

### State Commitment
A cryptographic commitment to the current state of a Layer 2 system, typically stored on the Layer 1 blockchain.

### Fraud Proof
Evidence submitted to prove that a previously accepted state transition on a Layer 2 solution was invalid.

### Challenge Period
A timeframe during which processed transactions in optimistic rollups can be challenged with fraud proofs.

### Sequencer
An entity responsible for ordering and processing transactions in a Layer 2 system before submitting them to Layer 1.

### Data Availability
The guarantee that transaction data is published and available for verification by network participants.

### Data Availability Committee (DAC)
A trusted group responsible for ensuring data availability in systems where data is not stored entirely on-chain.

## Zero-Knowledge Technology

### Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)
A cryptographic method that allows one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself.

### ZK-SNARK
Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARgument of Knowledge - a type of zero-knowledge proof that is small in size and quick to verify.

### ZK-STARK
Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent ARgument of Knowledge - a type of zero-knowledge proof that doesn't require a trusted setup and is quantum-resistant.

### Trusted Setup
A one-time ceremony required by certain zero-knowledge proof systems to generate initial parameters, requiring participants to destroy secret information.

### Validity Proof
A cryptographic proof that demonstrates the correctness of a computation or state transition without revealing the inputs.

### Circuit
A mathematical representation of a computation that can be proven using zero-knowledge proofs.

### Constraint
A mathematical relation that must be satisfied for a computation to be valid in a zero-knowledge circuit.

### Prover
The entity that generates a zero-knowledge proof to demonstrate knowledge of certain information.

### Verifier
The entity that checks the validity of a zero-knowledge proof without learning the underlying information.

### Recursive Proofs
A technique where one zero-knowledge proof verifies the correctness of another proof, enabling proof aggregation and scalability.

## Layer 3 and Multi-Chain

### Layer 3
Application-specific or specialized chains built on top of Layer 2 solutions, providing further optimization for specific use cases.

### Hyperchain
ProzChain's implementation of application-specific chains with specialized virtual machines and state models.

### Cross-Layer
Operations, transactions, or communications that span multiple layers of the blockchain scaling stack.

### Domain-Specific VM
A virtual machine optimized for a particular application domain, such as gaming, finance, or privacy.

### Bridge
A protocol that connects two blockchain networks, enabling asset transfers and data sharing between them.

### Cross-Chain
Interaction between two or more distinct blockchain networks.

### Interoperability
The ability of different blockchain systems to communicate and work together seamlessly.

### Trustless Bridge
A bridge between blockchains that doesn't require trusting a central entity or group of validators.

### Federated Bridge
A bridge secured by a known group of validators who are collectively responsible for its operation.

### Liquidity Network
A network of liquidity pools that facilitate asset transfers across different blockchain systems.

### Relayer
An entity that observes events on one blockchain and submits corresponding transactions to another blockchain.

## Economic Concepts

### MEV (Maximal Extractable Value)
The value that can be extracted from manipulating transactions within a block, beyond the standard block reward and gas fees.

### Fee Market
The economic system determining how transaction fees are set based on demand for block space.

### Security Budget
The total economic resources available to secure a blockchain against attacks, typically through rewards to validators or miners.

### Base Fee
The minimum required fee per unit of gas in an EIP-1559 style fee market, which is algorithmically adjusted based on network demand.

## Security Terminology

### Data Withholding Attack
An attack where operators of Layer 2 systems refuse to publish transaction data, preventing users from verifying the state or exiting the system.

### Eclipse Attack
An attack where a node's connections to honest peers are severed, leaving it connected only to attacker-controlled nodes.

### Exit Game
The protocol that allows users to withdraw assets from a Layer 2 system to the base layer, even if operators are malicious.

### Force Transaction
