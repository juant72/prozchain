# ZK-Rollups

## Overview

ZK-Rollups are a Layer 2 scaling solution that significantly increases ProzChain's throughput and reduces costs while maintaining strong security guarantees. They work by "rolling up" hundreds or thousands of transactions into a single batch, processing them off-chain, and then submitting only a succinct cryptographic proof (zero-knowledge proof) to the main chain that verifies the validity of all transactions in the batch.

This approach provides immediate finality, reduced on-chain data requirements, and enhanced privacy while inheriting the security of ProzChain's Layer 1.

## Core Concepts

### ZK-Rollup Fundamentals

ZK-Rollups work through the following key mechanisms:

1. **Transaction Batching**: Multiple transactions are grouped together in a batch
2. **Off-Chain Execution**: Transactions are executed in an off-chain environment
3. **State Commitment**: A cryptographic commitment to the post-transaction state is created
4. **Zero-Knowledge Proof Generation**: A ZK proof is created to verify execution correctness
5. **On-Chain Verification**: The proof and state commitment are verified and stored on L1

### Key Properties

ZK-Rollups in ProzChain have several defining characteristics:

1. **Immediate Finality**: No challenge period required, transactions are final when the proof is verified
2. **Data Availability**: All transaction data is published on-chain or to a data availability committee
3. **Strong Security**: Security inherits directly from Layer 1 with cryptographic guarantees
4. **Succinctness**: Verification is efficient regardless of the computation's complexity
5. **Privacy Options**: Potential for privacy-enhanced transactions through zero-knowledge technology

### Operator Components

The ZK-Rollup operator runs several critical components:

1. **Transaction Sequencer**:
   - Receives transactions from users
   - Validates basic transaction parameters
   - Orders transactions deterministically
   - Provides fast pre-confirmations

2. **Execution Engine**:
   - Processes transactions according to the rollup's rules
   - Updates the off-chain state
   - Generates execution traces for proof generation
   - Maintains compatibility with EVM semantics

3. **ZK Prover**:
   - Converts execution traces to circuit constraints
   - Generates zero-knowledge proofs of correct execution
   - Optimizes proof generation for performance
   - Handles circuit-specific optimizations

4. **State Manager**:
   - Maintains the current state merkle tree
   - Generates state transition commitments
   - Creates witness data for proof generation
   - Handles state synchronization

5. **Batch Builder**:
   - Groups transactions into optimal batches
   - Calculates batch metadata and commitment
   - Prepares data for on-chain submission
   - Optimizes for gas efficiency

6. **Proof Aggregator**:
   - Combines multiple proofs when possible
   - Implements recursive proof composition
   - Reduces on-chain verification costs
   - Handles proof compression techniques

### Smart Contract Components

The on-chain contracts manage interaction with Layer 1:

1. **Entry Point Contract**:
   - Accepts deposits from Layer 1
   - Registers new accounts
   - Initiates withdrawals to Layer 1
   - Handles emergency exits

2. **State Manager Contract**:
   - Stores state roots
   - Processes state updates
   - Validates state transitions
   - Maintains account registry

3. **Proof Verifier Contract**:
   - Validates zero-knowledge proofs
   - Authorizes state transitions
   - Implements cryptographic verification
   - Optimized for minimal gas usage

## Transaction Flow

A typical transaction through the ZK-Rollup follows these stages:

### 1. Transaction Submission

Users submit transactions through:

- Direct API submission to sequencer
- Web interface or wallet integration
- Smart contract interaction

The transaction includes:

```json
{
  "from": "0x123...",
  "to": "0x456...",
  "value": "1000000000000000000",
  "data": "0x...",
  "nonce": 42,
  "signature": "0xabc...",
  "gasPrice": "10000000000",
  "gasLimit": 100000,
  "validUntilBlock": 15000
}
```

### 2. Pre-Confirmation

After basic validation, the operator provides a fast pre-confirmation:

1. Signature verification
2. Nonce validation
3. Balance check
4. Conditional execution simulation

Pre-confirmation typically takes ~100ms and gives users immediate feedback.

### 3. Batch Assembly

Transactions are grouped into batches:

1. Ordered based on gas price and other metrics
2. Sized to optimize proof generation time and gas costs
3. Structured to minimize state access conflicts
4. Limited by circuit complexity constraints

### 4. Execution

The execution engine processes all transactions in the batch:

1. Sequential execution in deterministic order
2. State transitions are recorded
3. Execution trace is generated
4. Events and logs are emitted

### 5. Proof Generation

The ZK prover creates a validity proof:

1. Execution trace is converted to circuit constraints
2. Witness generation for the proof system
3. ZK-SNARK or ZK-STARK proof is created
4. Proof is compressed and optimized for verification

### 6. On-chain Submission

The batch data and proof are submitted to Layer 1:

1. Compressed transaction data is posted to calldata or data availability layer
2. State delta is calculated and committed
3. ZK proof is submitted to the verifier contract
4. State root is updated if proof verifies successfully

### 7. Finalization

Once the proof is verified on-chain:

1. New state root is finalized
2. Withdrawals are initiated (subject to delay for security)
3. Events are emitted for indexing and notifications
4. Block explorers and wallets update user interfaces

## ZK-Rollup Smart Contracts

The core smart contracts that enable ZK-Rollups:

### State Manager Contract

```solidity
// Simplified State Manager Contract

    );
    
    constructor(bytes32 _initialStateRoot, address _verifier) {
        stateRoot = _initialStateRoot;
        verifier = IZkVerifier(_verifier);
    }

    ) external {
        // Ensure batches are processed in order
        require(batchId == currentBatch, "Invalid batch id");
        
        // Ensure this batch hasn't been processed
        require(processedStateUpdates[batchId] == bytes32(0), "Batch already processed");
        
        // Verify the ZK proof
        require(
            verifier.verify(
                proof,
                [uint256(stateRoot), uint256(newStateRoot), uint256(transactionsHash)]
            ),
            "Invalid state transition proof"
        );
        
        // Update state root
        bytes32 previousStateRoot = stateRoot;
        stateRoot = newStateRoot;
        
        // Mark batch as processed
        processedStateUpdates[batchId] = newStateRoot;
        
        // Increment batch counter
        currentBatch++;

    }
    
    // Deposit ETH to the rollup
    function deposit(bytes32 accountHash) external payable {
        require(msg.value > 0, "Deposit amount must be greater than 0");
        
        // Emit deposit event

    }

            amount,
            stateRoot
        ));
        
        // Ensure withdrawal hasn't been processed
        require(!processedWithdrawals[withdrawalHash], "Withdrawal already processed");
        
        // Verify state root exists

            "Invalid merkle proof"
        );

    }
    
    // Finalize withdrawal after delay

        // Ensure delay has passed (implementation simplified)
        // In production, this would check block.number against the initiation block
        
        // Send funds to recipient
        (bool success, ) = recipient.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "ETH transfer failed");
        
        // Emit withdrawal finalized event
        emit WithdrawalFinalized(withdrawalHash, recipient, amount);
    }
}
```

    function verify(
        bytes calldata proof,
        uint256[] calldata inputs
    ) external view returns (bool) {
        // In a real implementation, this would:
