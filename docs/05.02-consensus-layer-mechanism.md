# 2. Consensus Mechanism

## 2.1 Design Principles
Core principles that guide ProzChain's consensus design.

```rust
struct ConsensusConfig {
    /// Type of consensus mechanism
    consensus_type: ConsensusType,
    /// Block time target in seconds
    block_time: u64,
    /// Maximum number of validators
    max_validators: usize,
    /// Minimum stake required to become a validator
    minimum_stake: Balance,
    /// Number of blocks in an epoch
    epoch_length: u64,
    /// Percentage of validators needed for quorum
    quorum_percentage: u8,
    /// Maximum allowable clock drift in milliseconds
    max_clock_drift: u64,
}

enum ConsensusType {
    ProofOfStake {
        finality_gadget: FinalityGadgetType,
    },
    ProofOfAuthority {
        authority_set_size: usize,
    },
    Hybrid {
        pos_weight: u8,
        poa_weight: u8,
    },
}

enum FinalityGadgetType {
    PBFT,
    Tendermint,
    Casper,
    None,
}
```

ProzChain's consensus mechanism is founded on several key design principles:

1. **Security First**: The mechanism prioritizes safety over liveness when tradeoffs must be made, ensuring that conflicting blocks are never finalized.

2. **Economic Finality**: By making attacks economically irrational through stake-based penalties, the system provides practical finality guarantees.

3. **Validator Rotation**: Regular rotation of the active validator set prevents centralization and improves network resilience.

4. **Resource Efficiency**: The consensus mechanism minimizes computational requirements, enabling participation by a broader set of validators.

5. **Permissionless Participation**: Anyone can become a validator by meeting the minimum stake requirement, maintaining the open nature of the network.

6. **Fair Rewards**: Block rewards and transaction fees are distributed proportionally to stake and participation, aligning incentives with network security.

7. **Accountable Safety**: When safety violations occur, the protocol provides cryptographic evidence of validator misbehavior, enabling appropriate penalties.

**For Beginners**: These design principles are like the constitutional laws that govern how decisions are made in ProzChain. They ensure the system remains secure, fair, and decentralized while providing clear rules for participants.

## 2.2 Proof of Stake
Stake-based consensus mechanism implementation.

    fork_choice: Arc<dyn ForkChoice>,
    /// Current chain state
    chain_state: ChainState,
    /// Staking configuration
    staking_config: StakingConfig,
}

struct StakingConfig {
    /// Minimum amount required to stake
    minimum_stake: Balance,
    /// Maximum number of validators
    max_validators: usize,
    /// Unbonding period in blocks
    unbonding_period: BlockHeight,
    /// Reward rate per block (annual percentage)
    reward_rate: f64,
    /// Slash percentage for equivocation

    /// Slash percentage for downtime
    slash_percentage_downtime: f64,
}

```

**Design Rationale**:
- **Modular Components**: Separates validator set management, block production, and finality
- **Configurable Parameters**: Allows tuning security vs. performance tradeoffs
- **Flexible Finality**: Supports multiple finality gadgets with different characteristics
- **Clear Selection Logic**: Transparent rules for validator selection and rotation

**For Beginners**: Proof of Stake is like a security deposit system. Validators put up valuable tokens as "stake" which gives them the right to create blocks. If they try to cheat, they lose part of their deposit. The more stake someone has, the more blocks they can create and the more rewards they earn, aligning economic incentives with honest behavior.

## 2.3 Protocol Flow
Step-by-step process of consensus operation.

```rust
struct ConsensusRound {
    height: BlockHeight,
    round: u32,
    step: ConsensusStep,
    proposer: Address,
    proposal: Option<Block>,
    prevotes: HashMap<Address, ConsensusVote>,
    precommits: HashMap<Address, ConsensusVote>,
    timeouts: HashMap<ConsensusStep, Instant>,
}

enum ConsensusStep {
    Propose,
    Prevote,
    Precommit,
    Commit,
}

impl StakingConsensus {
    fn run_consensus_round(&mut self) -> Result<Option<Block>> {
        // Initialize the consensus round
        let round = self.initialize_round()?;
        
        // Step 1: Block Proposal
        self.enter_propose_step(&mut round)?;
        let proposal = self.wait_for_proposal(&mut round)?;
        
        // Step 2: Pre-voting
        self.enter_prevote_step(&mut round)?;
        self.broadcast_prevote(&round, &proposal)?;
        let prevote_result = self.collect_prevotes(&mut round)?;
        
        // Step 3: Pre-committing
        self.enter_precommit_step(&mut round)?;
        self.broadcast_precommit(&round, &prevote_result)?;
        let precommit_result = self.collect_precommits(&mut round)?;
        
        // Step 4: Committing
        if precommit_result.has_quorum {
            self.enter_commit_step(&mut round)?;
            let committed_block = self.finalize_block(&round, precommit_result.block_hash)?;
            return Ok(Some(committed_block));
        }
        
        // No block committed this round
        Ok(None)
    }
    
    fn initialize_round(&self) -> Result<ConsensusRound> {
        let height = self.chain_state.current_height() + 1;
        let round = 0; // Start with round 0
        
        // Determine the proposer for this height/round
        let proposer = self.calculate_proposer(height, round)?;
        
        // Set timeouts for each step
        let mut timeouts = HashMap::new();
        timeouts.insert(ConsensusStep::Propose, Instant::now() + self.config.propose_timeout);
        timeouts.insert(ConsensusStep::Prevote, Instant::now() + self.config.propose_timeout + self.config.prevote_timeout);
        timeouts.insert(ConsensusStep::Precommit, Instant::now() + self.config.propose_timeout + self.config.prevote_timeout + self.config.precommit_timeout);
        
        Ok(ConsensusRound {
            height,
            round,
            step: ConsensusStep::Propose,
            proposer,
            proposal: None,
            prevotes: HashMap::new(),
            precommits: HashMap::new(),
            timeouts,
        })
    }
    
    fn calculate_proposer(&self, height: BlockHeight, round: u32) -> Result<Address> {
        // In the simplest case, use round-robin selection
        let validator_count = self.validator_set.validators().len();
        if validator_count == 0 {
            return Err(Error::NoValidators);
        }
        
        // Deterministic selection based on height and round
        let idx = ((height as u64 + round as u64) % validator_count as u64) as usize;
        let validators = self.validator_set.validators();
        
        // Return the selected validator's address
        Ok(validators[idx].address)
    }
    
    // Additional steps of the consensus round omitted for brevity
}
```

The consensus protocol in ProzChain follows a multi-step process designed to ensure agreement among validators:

1. **Block Proposal Phase**
   - A single validator is selected as the proposer for each height/round
   - The proposer collects transactions and creates a block proposal
   - The proposal is signed and broadcast to all validators

2. **Prevote Phase**
   - Validators receive and validate the proposal
   - If valid, they broadcast a PREVOTE message for the proposal
   - If invalid or not received in time, they PREVOTE for NULL
   - When a validator receives PREVOTE messages from 2/3+ of validators, it moves to precommit

3. **Precommit Phase**
   - If a validator received 2/3+ PREVOTES for the same block, it broadcasts a PRECOMMIT for that block
   - Otherwise, it broadcasts a PRECOMMIT for NULL
   - When a validator receives PRECOMMIT messages from 2/3+ of validators for the same block, it commits that block

4. **Commit Phase**
   - The block is added to the chain and finalized
   - The state transitions in the block are applied
   - Validators move to the next height

5. **Timeout Handling**
   - If any phase doesn't complete in time, a timeout occurs
   - On timeout, validators move to the next round at the same height
   - Each new round has a new proposer and starts the process again

This multi-phase voting process ensures that:
1. All honest validators agree on the same block (safety)
2. The system makes progress as long as 2/3+ of validators are honest and online (liveness)
3. Validators have cryptographic proof of finality for each block

**For Beginners**: The consensus protocol is like a structured group decision-making process. First, one person (the proposer) suggests a decision. Then everyone votes in two rounds - first to indicate they received the proposal, then to confirm they agree with it. If enough people vote the same way in both rounds, the decision is made final.
