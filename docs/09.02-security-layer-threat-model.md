# 2. Threat Model

This chapter presents a comprehensive threat model for the ProzChain platform, identifying potential security threats, categorizing them by severity and likelihood, and outlining mitigation strategies.

## 2.1 Threat Modeling Approach

ProzChain employs the STRIDE threat modeling methodology to systematically identify threats:

- **Spoofing**: Impersonating another user or system component
- **Tampering**: Modifying data without authorization
- **Repudiation**: Denying having performed an action
- **Information disclosure**: Exposing sensitive information
- **Denial of service**: Preventing legitimate access to system resources
- **Elevation of privilege**: Gaining unauthorized capabilities

Each identified threat is then evaluated using the DREAD risk assessment model:

- **Damage potential**: How severe is the damage if the threat is realized
- **Reproducibility**: How easily can the attack be reproduced
- **Exploitability**: How much effort is required to execute the attack
- **Affected users**: How many users would be affected
- **Discoverability**: How easily can the vulnerability be discovered

## 2.2 Threat Actors

The threat model considers the following potential adversaries:

### 2.2.1 External Attackers

- **Financially motivated hackers**: Individuals or groups seeking financial gain
- **Nation-state actors**: Government-sponsored entities with significant resources

### 2.2.2 Internal Threats

- **Malicious insiders**: Team members or validators with privileged access
- **Compromised developers**: Legitimate developers whose accounts may be compromised
- **Negligent users**: Non-malicious users who may make security mistakes
