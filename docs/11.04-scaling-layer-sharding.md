# Sharding

## Overview

Sharding is a horizontal scaling technique that divides the ProzChain network into smaller, more manageable partitions called shards. Each shard processes a subset of transactions and maintains a portion of the global state, allowing the network to process many transactions in parallel. This approach significantly increases throughput and capacity while maintaining the security and decentralization of the blockchain.

ProzChain implements a comprehensive sharding architecture that addresses the challenges of data availability, cross-shard communication, and secure state management to create a highly scalable blockchain system.

## Core Concepts

### Sharding Fundamentals

Sharding in ProzChain works through these key mechanisms:

1. **Network Partitioning**: The network is divided into multiple shards, each with its own validators
2. **Parallel Processing**: Shards process transactions independently and in parallel
3. **Cross-Shard Communication**: Secure protocols enable transactions across shards
4. **Global Consensus**: Beacon chain coordinates the overall network and shard committees

### Types of Sharding

ProzChain implements multiple forms of sharding:

- **Network Sharding**: Dividing the peer-to-peer network topology
- **Transaction Sharding**: Distributing transaction processing across shards
- **State Sharding**: Partitioning the global state across shards

### The Sharding Trilemma

Sharding designs must balance three competing objectives:
1. **Scalability**: Increasing transaction throughput
2. **Security**: Maintaining resistance to attacks
3. **Decentralization**: Ensuring permissionless participation

## ProzChain Sharding Architecture

The ProzChain sharding architecture consists of multiple interconnected components:

```

### Beacon Chain

The Beacon Chain serves as the coordinator for the entire sharded network:

1. **Validator Registry**: Maintains the list of all active validators
2. **Committee Selection**: Assigns validators to shards using secure randomness
3. **Finality Gadget**: Provides finality for all shard blocks
4. **Cross-Shard Coordination**: Enables secure communication between shards
5. **Global Clock**: Maintains synchronized timing across all shards

### Shard Chains

Each shard functions as a mini-blockchain with its own:

1. **Consensus Mechanism**: BFT consensus protocol optimized for shards
2. **State Database**: Manages the portion of the global state assigned to the shard
3. **Execution Environment**: Processes transactions and smart contracts
4. **Cross-Shard Interface**: Handles messages to and from other shards
5. **Validator Committee**: Rotated set of validators assigned from the global pool

### Validator Rotation

Validators are regularly reassigned to different shards to enhance security:

1. **Secure Shuffling**: Uses verifiable random function (VRF) for unpredictable assignment
2. **Rotation Frequency**: Validators rotate every N epochs (e.g., daily)
3. **Committee Size**: Each shard has M validators (e.g., 128 per shard)
4. **Overlap Periods**: Ensures smooth transitions between rotations

## Shard Assignment

### Transaction Routing

Transactions are routed to appropriate shards based on:

1. **Account-Based Routing**: Transactions go to shards containing relevant accounts
2. **Contract-Based Routing**: Smart contract calls go to shards containing the contracts
3. **Cross-Shard Routing**: Complex transactions may involve multiple shards

### Smart Contract Placement

Smart contracts are assigned to specific shards through:

1. **Initial Deployment**: Contract is deployed to a specific shard
2. **Contract Migration**: Contracts can migrate between shards under certain conditions
3. **Replication**: Some contracts can be replicated across multiple shards

### Load Balancing

ProzChain implements dynamic load balancing to prevent shard congestion:

1. **Usage Monitoring**: Tracks computational and storage load per shard
2. **Dynamic Resharding**: Adjusts shard boundaries based on load
3. **State Migration**: Moves accounts and contracts to maintain balance
4. **Fee Adjustment**: Uses fee markets to incentivize balanced usage

## Cross-Shard Communication

### Atomic Cross-Shard Transactions

ProzChain enables atomic operations across multiple shards:

1. **Two-Phase Commit**: Ensures all-or-nothing execution across shards
2. **Receipt-Based Approach**: Uses transaction receipts to verify cross-shard actions
3. **Merkle Proofs**: Validates state in other shards
4. **Shard-wide Locking**: Prevents race conditions for cross-shard operations

### Cross-Shard Messaging Protocol

The messaging protocol between shards includes:

1. **Message Format**: Standardized format with origination and destination information
2. **Message Queue**: Ordered buffering of cross-shard messages
3. **Verification Mechanism**: Ensuring message authenticity
4. **Relay Protocol**: Secured forwarding of messages between shards
5. **Error Handling**: Dealing with message failures and timeouts

```json
{
  "messageId": "msg_0x1234...",
  "fromShard": 2,
  "toShard": 5,
  "sourceAddress": "0xabcd...",
  "destinationAddress": "0xef01...",
  "value": "1000000000000000000",
  "data": "0x...",
  "gasLimit": 100000,
  "nonce": 42,
  "signature": "0xae23..."
}
```

### Domain-Based Sharding

ProzChain implements domain-based sharding for improved application performance:

1. **Application Domains**: Related contracts and accounts are grouped together
2. **Domain Routing**: Transactions within a domain stay within the same shard
3. **Domain Migration**: Entire domains can migrate between shards
4. **Domain Management**: Applications can register and manage their domains

## Data Availability and State Management

### State Representation

Each shard maintains its own portion of the global state:

1. **Account State**: Balance and nonce for accounts in the shard
2. **Contract State**: Storage and code for contracts in the shard
3. **State Merkle Tree**: Efficient representation and verification of state
4. **State Diffs**: Compact representation of state changes

### Merkleized State Access

ProzChain uses Merkle trees for efficient state verification:

1. **State Merkle Root**: Each shard maintains its own state root
2. **Global State Root**: Beacon chain aggregates shard state roots
3. **State Proofs**: Efficiently prove state inclusion across shards
4. **Verkle Trees**: Advanced data structure for more efficient state proofs

### Data Availability Guarantees

ProzChain ensures data needed for state verification is always available:

1. **Data Availability Sampling**: Validators sample data to verify availability
2. **Erasure Coding**: Data is encoded to allow recovery from partial information
3. **Data Attestations**: Validators attest to data availability
4. **Fraud Proofs**: Mechanism to prove data unavailability

## Shard Security

### Shard Security Model

ProzChain's sharding security relies on multiple mechanisms:

1. **Honest Majority Assumption**: Requires majority of validators in each shard to be honest
2. **Random Validator Assignment**: Prevents attackers from targeting specific shards
3. **Minimum Committee Size**: Ensures sufficient validators for security
4. **Fisherman Challenge**: Allows any validator to challenge invalid shard blocks
5. **Stake Slashing**: Economic penalties for malicious behavior

### Cross-Shard Attack Prevention

Mechanisms to prevent attacks that exploit the sharded architecture:

1. **Double-spending Prevention**: Cross-referencing transactions across shards
2. **Shard Takeover Resistance**: Validator shuffling prevents long-term control
3. **Data Withholding Defense**: Ensures required data is available for verification
4. **Eclipse Attack Prevention**: Network topology design to prevent shard isolation
5. **Long-range Attack Mitigation**: Finality gadget prevents history revisions

### Security Thresholds

Security guarantees based on validator committee sizes:

| Committee Size | Malicious Validators | Security Guarantee |
|----------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| 64 | <22 (33%) | High security for most applications |
| 128 | <43 (33%) | Enhanced security for high-value transactions |
| 256 | <86 (33%) | Maximum security for critical operations |

## Performance and Scalability

### Throughput Scaling

ProzChain's sharding achieves throughput scaling proportional to shard count:

1. **Linear Scaling**: Throughput increases nearly linearly with shard count
2. **Parallelization**: Independent transaction processing across shards
3. **Optimized Consensus**: Shard-specific consensus optimizations
4. **Execution Efficiency**: Smaller state enables faster transaction execution

### Current and Projected Performance

| Configuration | Shards | TPS per Shard | Total Network TPS | State Size per Shard |
|---------------|--------|---------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Initial | 4 | 1,000 | 4,000 | 100GB |
| Phase 2 | 16 | 1,000 | 16,000 | 50GB |
| Target | 64 | 1,000 | 64,000 | 25GB |
| Theoretical Max | 1,024 | 1,000 | 1,024,000 | 10GB |

### Latency Considerations

Sharding impacts transaction latency differently based on transaction type:

1. **Intra-Shard Transactions**: 1-2 second finality (single-shard operations)
2. **Cross-Shard Transactions**: 4-8 second finality (multi-shard operations)
3. **Global Transactions**: 8-15 second finality (operations affecting many shards)

### Shard Count Scaling

ProzChain's roadmap for increasing shard count:

1. **Initial Phase**: 4 shards with conservative parameters
2. **Expansion Phase**: Gradual increase to 16 shards with proven security
3. **Mature Network**: Up to 64 shards with optimized cross-shard communication
4. **Final Vision**: Dynamic shard count based on network demand

## Implementation Details

### Consensus in Sharded Environment

Each shard uses a tailored consensus protocol:

1. **Committee-Based BFT**: Modified BFT consensus with rotating committees
2. **Block Production**: Leader-based block proposal with fast validation
3. **Crosslinking**: Periodic commitments of shard states to the beacon chain
4. **Finality**: Two-phase finality with global coordination

### Validator Selection Algorithm

Secure validator assignment uses a verifiable random function:

```python
# Pseudocode for validator assignment
def assign_validators_to_shards(validators, num_shards, seed):
    # Cryptographically secure shuffling using VRF
    shuffled_validators = vrf_shuffle(validators, seed)
    
    assignments = [[] for _ in range(num_shards)]
    validators_per_shard = len(validators) // num_shards
    
    # Assign validators to shards
    for i, validator in enumerate(shuffled_validators):
        shard_id = i % num_shards
        assignments[shard_id].append(validator)
    
    return assignments
```

### Cross-Shard Transaction Flow

The flow of a cross-shard transaction:

1. **Submission**: Transaction is submitted to its originating shard
2. **Execution in Source Shard**: Source shard executes its portion of the transaction
3. **Cross-Shard Message Creation**: Source shard generates messages for target shards
4. **Message Relay**: Messages are relayed to target shards via the beacon chain
5. **Receipt Verification**: Target shards verify the source shard's receipt
6. **Target Shard Execution**: Target shards execute their portion of the transaction
7. **Completion**: Transaction is considered complete when all shards confirm execution

### Network Topology

ProzChain implements a specialized network topology for sharding:

1. **Shard Subnets**: Dedicated peer-to-peer networks for each shard
2. **Global Network**: Network connecting all validators regardless of shard
3. **Beacon Chain Network**: High-priority network for beacon chain operations
4. **Cross-Shard Relay Network**: Optimized paths for cross-shard communication

3. **Asynchronous Interaction Patterns**: Design with cross-shard latency in mind
4. **State Access Optimization**: Minimize cross-shard state dependencies
5. **Smart Contract Placement**: Strategic deployment of contracts to optimal shards

### Example: Multi-Shard DeFi Application

```solidity
// Smart contract design for sharded architecture
contract ShardAwareToken {
    // Shard registry tracks token balances across shards
    mapping(uint256 => address) public shardRegistries;
    
    // Set registry for a specific shard
    function setShardRegistry(uint256 shardId, address registry) external onlyOwner {
        shardRegistries[shardId] = registry;
    }
    
    // Transfer within same shard - fast and efficient
    function transferSameShard(address to, uint256 amount) external {
        // Standard transfer logic
    }
    
    // Transfer to different shard - requires cross-shard messaging
    function transferCrossShard(address to, uint256 amount, uint256 targetShard) external {
        // Lock tokens in source shard
        _burn(msg.sender, amount);
        
        // Create cross-shard message
        bytes memory message = abi.encode(msg.sender, to, amount);
        
        // Initiate cross-shard communication
        CrossShardCoordinator.sendMessage(targetShard, shardRegistries[targetShard], message);
        
        // Target shard will mint tokens when message is received
    }
}
```
