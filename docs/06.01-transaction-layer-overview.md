# 1. Overview

The Transaction Layer is the component of ProzChain responsible for processing and managing transactions. It serves as the interface through which users interact with the blockchain and defines how changes to the state are proposed, validated, and executed.

## Core Responsibilities

- **Transaction Definition**: Providing a standardized format for expressing state changes
- **Transaction Validation**: Ensuring only valid transactions are processed
- **Transaction Ordering**: Determining the sequence in which transactions are executed
- **Transaction Execution**: Coordinating the application of state changes
- **Fee Management**: Handling incentive structures for transaction inclusion

## Key Features of ProzChain's Transaction Layer

ProzChain's transaction layer is designed with several distinguishing features:

1. **Multi-Transaction Types**: Support for various transaction types with different execution semantics
2. **Parallel Transaction Processing**: Efficient concurrent execution of non-conflicting transactions
3. **Adaptable Fee Model**: Dynamic fee structures that adjust to network conditions
4. **Privacy Options**: Configurable privacy features for sensitive transactions
5. **High Throughput**: Architecture optimized for processing large transaction volumes

## Relation to Other Layers

The Transaction Layer interfaces closely with:

- **State Layer**: Applies transaction effects to the current state
- **Consensus Layer**: Receives ordered batches of transactions for inclusion in blocks
- **Network Layer**: Transmits transactions across the peer-to-peer network
- **Cryptography Layer**: Utilizes digital signatures and hashing functions for security
- **Smart Contract Layer**: Processes transactions that invoke smart contract functionality

## Architecture Overview

The transaction layer employs a modular architecture consisting of:

```rust
/// Main entry point for transaction processing
struct TransactionProcessor {
    mempool: TransactionPool,
    validator: TransactionValidator,
    executor: TransactionExecutor,
    fee_manager: FeeManager,
    state_access: Arc<StateManager>,
}

/// Manages pending transactions awaiting inclusion in blocks
struct TransactionPool {
    pending: HashMap<Hash, Transaction>,
    queued: PriorityQueue<Transaction>,
    by_sender: HashMap<Address, Vec<Hash>>,
    config: PoolConfig,
}

/// Validates transaction structure, signatures, and rules
struct TransactionValidator {
    chain_rules: Arc<ChainRules>,
    state_view: Arc<StateView>,
}

/// Executes transactions against the state
struct TransactionExecutor {
    state_manager: Arc<StateManager>,
    vm_environment: Arc<ExecutionEnvironment>,
    gas_accountant: GasAccountant,
}

/// Manages fee-related aspects of transactions
struct FeeManager {
    fee_estimator: FeeEstimator,
    fee_market: FeeMarket,
    fee_distributor: FeeDistributor,
}
```

In subsequent chapters, we will explore each component of the transaction layer in greater detail, providing both conceptual understanding and practical implementation guidance.
