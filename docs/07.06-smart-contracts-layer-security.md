# 6. Security Features

Security is fundamental to ProzChain's smart contract platform. This chapter covers the security mechanisms that protect contracts and their users from vulnerabilities and attacks.

## 6.1 Security Model

The ProzChain smart contract security model is built on multiple layers of protection:

```rust
/// Core security framework for smart contracts
struct SecurityFramework {
    /// Static analysis tools
    static_analyzers: Vec<Box<dyn StaticAnalyzer>>,
    
    /// Runtime protection systems
    runtime_protections: Vec<Box<dyn RuntimeProtection>>,
    
    /// Formal verification tools
    verification_tools: Vec<Box<dyn FormalVerifier>>,
    
    /// Reputation and trust systems
    trust_systems: Vec<Box<dyn TrustSystem>>,
    
    /// Security configuration
    config: SecurityConfig,
}

/// Security configuration options
struct SecurityConfig {
    /// Security level for deployments
    deployment_security_level: SecurityLevel,
    
    /// Whether to require code verification
    require_verification: bool,
    
    /// Maximum allowed vulnerability severity
    max_vulnerability_severity: VulnerabilitySeverity,
    
    /// Trusted code sources
    trusted_sources: HashSet<TrustedSource>,
    
    /// Runtime monitoring level
    runtime_monitoring: MonitoringLevel,
}

/// Security level settings
enum SecurityLevel {
    Standard,
    Enhanced,
    Maximum,
    Custom(SecurityCustomization),
}

/// Severity levels for vulnerabilities
enum VulnerabilitySeverity {
    Critical,
    High,
    Medium,
    Low,
    Informational,
}

/// Runtime monitoring intensity
enum MonitoringLevel {
    None,
    Basic,
    Comprehensive,
    Full,
}
```

## 6.2 Static Analysis

Static analysis examines contract code for vulnerabilities before deployment:

```rust
/// Interface for static analyzers
trait StaticAnalyzer: Send + Sync {
    /// Analyze contract code for vulnerabilities
    fn analyze(&self, code: &str, language: &Language) 
        -> Result<AnalysisReport, AnalysisError>;
        
    /// Get analyzer name
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    
    /// Get supported languages
    fn supported_languages(&self) -> &[Language];
}

/// Report from static analysis
struct AnalysisReport {
    /// Overall security score (0-100)
    security_score: u8,
    
    /// Detected vulnerabilities
    vulnerabilities: Vec<Vulnerability>,
    
    /// Recommendations for improving security
    recommendations: Vec<SecurityRecommendation>,
    
    /// Gas optimization suggestions
    optimizations: Vec<GasOptimization>,
    
    /// Analysis metadata
    metadata: AnalysisMetadata,
}

/// Detected vulnerability
struct Vulnerability {
    /// Vulnerability type
    vulnerability_type: VulnerabilityType,
    
    /// Severity level
    severity: VulnerabilitySeverity,
    
    /// Location in the code
    location: CodeLocation,
    
    /// Description of the issue
    description: String,
    
    /// Suggested fix
    suggested_fix: Option<String>,
    
    /// Related CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) ID
    cwe_id: Option<String>,
}

/// Common vulnerability types
enum VulnerabilityType {
    ReentrancyVulnerability,
    IntegerOverflow,
    UncheckedExternalCall,
    AccessControlIssue,
    DosVulnerability,
    FrontRunningVulnerability,
    OracleManipulation,
    BlockTimestampDependence,
    PrivateDataExposure,
    RandomnessManipulation,
    UnprotectedSelfDestruct,
    FunctionDefaultVisibility,
    CustomVulnerability(String),
}
```

### Vulnerability Detection Patterns

ProzChain implements detection patterns for common vulnerabilities:

```rust
/// Reentrancy detector
struct ReentrancyDetector;

impl StaticAnalyzer for ReentrancyDetector {
    fn analyze(&self, code: &str, language: &Language) -> Result<AnalysisReport, AnalysisError> {
        let mut report = AnalysisReport::new();
        
        match language {
            Language::Solidity => {
                // Parse code to AST
                let ast = parse_solidity_to_ast(code)?;
                
                // Find external calls followed by state changes
                let vulnerabilities = find_state_changes_after_external_calls(&ast);
                
                // Add detected vulnerabilities to report
                for vuln in vulnerabilities {
                    report.add_vulnerability(Vulnerability {
                        vulnerability_type: VulnerabilityType::ReentrancyVulnerability,
                        severity: VulnerabilitySeverity::Critical,
                        location: vuln.location,
                        description: "State changes after external call may enable reentrancy attacks".to_string(),
                        suggested_fix: Some("Implement checks-effects-interactions pattern or use ReentrancyGuard".to_string()),
                        cwe_id: Some("CWE-841".to_string()),
                    });
                }
                
                // Add recommendation for reentrancy guard if external calls exist
                if has_external_calls(&ast) {
                    report.add_recommendation(SecurityRecommendation {
                        title: "Use Reentrancy Guard".to_string(),
                        description: "Consider using a reentrancy guard for functions with external calls".to_string(),
                        priority: RecommendationPriority::High,
                    });
                }
            },
            // Other language implementations...
            _ => return Err(AnalysisError::UnsupportedLanguage),
        }
        
        Ok(report)
    }
    
    fn name(&self) -> &str {
        "Reentrancy Detector"
    }
    
    fn supported_languages(&self) -> &[Language] {
        &[Language::Solidity, Language::Vyper]
    }
}

/// Integer overflow/underflow detector
struct IntegerOverflowDetector;

impl StaticAnalyzer for IntegerOverflowDetector {
    // Implementation details...
}
```

## 6.3 Runtime Protections

Runtime protections monitor and enforce security constraints during contract execution:

```rust
/// Interface for runtime protections
trait RuntimeProtection: Send + Sync {
    /// Initialize protection for a contract
    fn initialize(&self, contract: &Contract) -> Result<(), ProtectionError>;
    
    /// Process a transaction before execution
    fn pre_execution(&self, context: &ExecutionContext) -> Result<(), ProtectionError>;
    
    /// Process a transaction after execution
    fn post_execution(&self, context: &ExecutionContext, result: &ExecutionResult)
        -> Result<(), ProtectionError>;
    
    /// Get protection name
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    
    /// Performance impact level
    fn performance_impact(&self) -> PerformanceImpact;
}

/// Possible protection actions
enum ProtectionAction {
    /// Allow the transaction
    Allow,
    
    /// Reject the transaction
    Reject(String),
    
    /// Modify the transaction
    Modify(TransactionModification),
    
    /// Add monitoring to the transaction
    Monitor,
}

/// Performance impact levels
enum PerformanceImpact {
    None,
    Low,
    Medium,
    High,
}

/// Reentrancy guard implementation
struct ReentrancyGuard {
    /// Currently locked contracts
    locked_contracts: RwLock<HashSet<Address>>,
    
    /// Lock timeout
    lock_timeout: Duration,
    
    /// Configuration options
    config: ReentrancyGuardConfig,
}

impl RuntimeProtection for ReentrancyGuard {
    fn pre_execution(&self, context: &ExecutionContext) -> Result<(), ProtectionError> {
        // Get the contract being called
        let contract = context.contract;
        
        // Check if contract is locked (would indicate reentrancy)
        let locked = {
            let locks = self.locked_contracts.read().unwrap();
            locks.contains(&contract)
        };
        
        if locked {
            return Err(ProtectionError::ReentrancyDetected {
                contract,
                call_chain: context.call_chain.clone(),
            });
        }
        
        // Lock the contract for the duration of the call
        {
            let mut locks = self.locked_contracts.write().unwrap();
            locks.insert(contract);
        }
        
        Ok(())
    }
    
    fn post_execution(&self, context: &ExecutionContext, _result: &ExecutionResult)
        -> Result<(), ProtectionError> 
    {
        // Unlock the contract after execution
        {
            let mut locks = self.locked_contracts.write().unwrap();
            locks.remove(&context.contract);
        }
        
        Ok(())
    }
    
    fn name(&self) -> &str {
        "Reentrancy Guard"
    }
    
    fn performance_impact(&self) -> PerformanceImpact {
        PerformanceImpact::Low
    }
}
```

## 6.4 Formal Verification

Formal verification provides mathematical proofs of contract correctness:

```rust
/// Interface for formal verification tools
trait FormalVerifier: Send + Sync {
    /// Verify contract properties
    fn verify(&self, contract: &Contract, properties: &[Property]) 
        -> Result<VerificationResult, VerificationError>;
    
    /// Get verifier name
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    
    /// Get supported property types
    fn supported_property_types(&self) -> &[PropertyType];
}

/// Formal verification property
struct Property {
    /// Property name
    name: String,
    
    /// Property type
    property_type: PropertyType,
    
    /// Property specification in appropriate language
    specification: String,
    
    /// Natural language description
    description: String,
    
    /// Severity if the property is violated
    severity: PropertySeverity,
}

/// Types of formal properties
enum PropertyType {
    /// Property must always be true
    Invariant,
    
    /// Property must eventually become true
    Liveness,
    
    /// Property ensures something happens before something else
    Precedence,
    
    /// Property must be true for all possible inputs
    UniversalInput,
    
    /// Custom property type
    Custom(String),
}

/// Result of verification
struct VerificationResult {
    /// Whether verification was successful
    verified: bool,
    
    /// Verified properties
    verified_properties: Vec<VerifiedProperty>,
    
    /// Counterexamples for failed properties
    counterexamples: Vec<Counterexample>,
    
    /// Verification statistics
    stats: VerificationStats,
}

/// Result for a single property
struct VerifiedProperty {
    /// Reference to the property
    property: Property,
    
    /// Whether the property was verified
    verified: bool,
    
    /// Time taken to verify
    verification_time: Duration,
    
    /// Additional information about verification
    info: String,
}

/// Counterexample for a failed property
struct Counterexample {
    /// Property that failed
    property: Property,
    
    /// Input values that cause failure
    inputs: HashMap<String, Value>,
    
    /// State that leads to failure
    state: HashMap<String, Value>,
    
    /// Execution trace leading to failure
    trace: Vec<TraceStep>,
}
```

## 6.5 Security Audit Tools

ProzChain provides tools to audit contracts for security:

```rust
/// Contract audit system
struct AuditSystem {
    /// Available audit tools
    audit_tools: Vec<Box<dyn AuditTool>>,
    
    /// Audit rules and policies
    audit_policies: Vec<AuditPolicy>,
    
    /// Recent audit results
    audit_history: AuditHistory,
    
    /// Configuration
    config: AuditConfig,
}

/// Interface for audit tools
trait AuditTool: Send + Sync {
    /// Conduct an audit of a contract
    fn audit(&self, contract: &Contract, options: &AuditOptions) -> Result<AuditReport, AuditError>;
    
    /// Get tool name
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    
    /// Get tool capabilities
    fn capabilities(&self) -> &[AuditCapability];
}

/// Audit report
struct AuditReport {
    /// Overall security score
    security_score: u8,
    
    /// Audit findings
    findings: Vec<AuditFinding>,
    
    /// Recommendations
    recommendations: Vec<AuditRecommendation>,
    
    /// Auditability score (how easy to audit)
    auditability_score: u8,
    
    /// Audit metadata
    metadata: AuditMetadata,
}

/// Security finding in an audit
struct AuditFinding {
    /// Finding type
    finding_type: FindingType,
    
    /// Severity level
    severity: VulnerabilitySeverity,
    
    /// Finding title
    title: String,
    
    /// Detailed description
    description: String,
    
    /// Affected components
    affected_components: Vec<String>,
    
    /// Fix recommendation
    fix: String,
}

/// Types of audit findings
enum FindingType {
    Vulnerability,
    CodeQualityIssue,
    GasOptimization,
    BusinessLogicConcern,
    ComplianceIssue,
    DocumentationDeficiency,
    DesignFlaw,
    Custom(String),
}
```

## 6.6 Attack Simulations

ProzChain can simulate attacks to test contract security:

```rust
/// Attack simulation framework
struct AttackSimulator {
    /// Available attack vectors
    attack_vectors: Vec<Box<dyn AttackVector>>,
    
    /// Simulation environment
    environment: SimulationEnvironment,
    
    /// Reporting system
    reporter: SimulationReporter,
}

/// Interface for attack vectors
trait AttackVector: Send + Sync {
    /// Attempt to exploit a contract
    fn exploit(&self, contract: &Contract, environment: &mut SimulationEnvironment) 
        -> SimulationResult;
    
    /// Get attack name
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    
    /// Get attack description
    fn description(&self) -> &str;
    
    /// Expected security impact if successful
    fn security_impact(&self) -> SecurityImpact;
}

/// Simulation environment for attacks
struct SimulationEnvironment {
    /// Simulated blockchain
    blockchain: SimulatedBlockchain,
    
    /// Attack accounts
    attack_accounts: Vec<SimulatedAccount>,
    
    /// Victim accounts
    victim_accounts: Vec<SimulatedAccount>,
    
    /// Contract under test
    target_contract: Contract,
    
    /// Related contracts
    related_contracts: HashMap<Address, Contract>,
}

/// Result of an attack simulation
struct SimulationResult {
    /// Whether the attack was successful
    success: bool,
    
    /// Assets extracted/damaged if successful
    assets_affected: Option<AssetImpact>,
    
    /// Exception generated if attack failed
    exception: Option<SimulationException>,
    
    /// Execution trace
    trace: Vec<SimulationTraceItem>,
    
    /// Security implications
    security_implications: Vec<SecurityImplication>,
}

/// Impact on assets
struct AssetImpact {
    /// Funds extracted
    funds_extracted: Balance,
    
    /// Assets damaged/stolen
    assets_damaged: Vec<AssetDamage>,
    
    /// Permission escalations achieved
    permission_escalations: Vec<PermissionEscalation>,
}
```

**Design Rationale**:
- **Multi-layered Security**: Combines static, runtime, and formal verification approaches
- **Proactive Protection**: Identifies vulnerabilities before they can be exploited
- **Simulation-based Testing**: Tests real-world attack scenarios
- **Customizable Security Levels**: Allows different security requirements for different applications
- **Formal Guarantees**: Provides mathematical assurance for critical properties

**For Beginners**: Smart contract security is crucial because vulnerabilities can lead to loss of funds and trust. ProzChain provides multiple security layers: static analysis (examining code before deployment), runtime protections (monitoring during execution), formal verification (mathematical proofs of correctness), and security auditing tools. These work together to ensure that contracts behave as expected and resist attacks. Different security levels can be applied based on the contract's importance and the value it manages.
