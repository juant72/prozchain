# ProzChain Transaction Lifecycle

## Overview

This documentation series provides a comprehensive overview of the complete lifecycle of transactions within the ProzChain network, from creation through execution to finality. Understanding this lifecycle is crucial for developers building applications on ProzChain, operators maintaining network infrastructure, and users seeking to optimize their transaction experience.

## Transaction Lifecycle Stages

The transaction journey through ProzChain can be divided into several key stages:

1. [Transaction Creation](./transaction-lifecycle-creation.md)
   - Transaction structure and types
   - Transaction signing and security
   - Client-side transaction preparation
   - Account management and nonce tracking

2. [Transaction Submission](./transaction-lifecycle-submission.md)
   - Submission methods and interfaces
   - Client libraries and tools
   - Fee estimation and gas management
   - Submission best practices

3. [Mempool Management](./transaction-lifecycle-mempool.md)
   - Transaction validation and acceptance
   - Mempool structure and organization
   - Fee market dynamics
   - Transaction replacement rules

4. [Transaction Propagation](./transaction-lifecycle-propagation.md)
   - Network communication protocols
   - Propagation strategies and optimization
   - Privacy considerations
   - Network health and congestion handling

5. [Block Inclusion](./transaction-lifecycle-block-inclusion.md)
   - Validator transaction selection
   - Block composition strategies
   - Fee-based prioritization
   - MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) considerations

6. [Transaction Execution](./transaction-lifecycle-execution.md)
   - PVM (ProzChain Virtual Machine) execution model
   - Gas mechanics and resource accounting
   - Smart contract interactions
   - Execution optimizations

7. [State Changes](./transaction-lifecycle-state-changes.md)
   - Account and balance updates
   - Smart contract state modifications
   - Storage structures and merkle trees
   - State transition verification

8. [Transaction Receipts](./transaction-lifecycle-receipts.md)
   - Receipt structure and generation
   - Event logs and bloom filters
   - Receipt storage and retrieval
   - Receipt usage patterns

9. [Finality](./transaction-lifecycle-finality.md)
   - Consensus-based finality
   - Probabilistic vs. deterministic finality
   - Confirmation thresholds
   - Cross-chain finality considerations

10. [Exceptional Conditions](./transaction-lifecycle-exceptions.md)
    - Transaction failures and rejections
    - Network partitions and reorgs
    - Error handling strategies
    - Recovery mechanisms
