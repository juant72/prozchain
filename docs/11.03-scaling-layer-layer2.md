# Layer 2 Solutions

## Introduction

Layer 2 (L2) solutions are protocols built on top of the main blockchain (Layer 1) that handle transactions off the main chain while inheriting the security guarantees of the underlying blockchain. ProzChain implements several Layer 2 solutions to significantly increase throughput, reduce latency, and lower transaction costs without compromising on security.

This document provides an overview of the Layer 2 scaling solutions implemented in ProzChain, explaining their technical foundations, trade-offs, and integration with the broader scaling architecture.

## Layer 2 Solutions in ProzChain

ProzChain implements three primary categories of Layer 2 solutions:

1. **Rollups**: Batch transactions off-chain and submit compressed data or proofs to Layer 1
2. **State Channels**: Enable direct off-chain transactions between parties
3. **Sidechains**: Process transactions on separate chains with their own consensus mechanisms

Each solution offers different trade-offs and is suitable for different use cases within the ProzChain ecosystem.

## Rollups

Rollups execute transactions off-chain but post transaction data or proofs on-chain, inheriting the security of the Layer 1 while significantly increasing throughput.

### Types of Rollups in ProzChain

ProzChain implements two types of rollups:

1. **Optimistic Rollups**: Assume transactions are valid by default and rely on fraud proofs
2. **Zero-Knowledge Rollups**: Use cryptographic proofs to validate transaction batches

### Key Rollup Components

Rollups in ProzChain consist of several core components:

- **Sequencer**: Orders and executes transactions off-chain
- **Aggregator**: Bundles transactions and generates proofs
- **Verifier Contract**: On-chain contract that verifies proofs or challenges
- **State Contract**: Stores the latest state root and handles deposits/withdrawals
- **Data Availability Layer**: Ensures transaction data is available for verification

### Rollup Integration with Layer 1

Rollups interact with the ProzChain Layer 1 through:

- **State Commitments**: Merkle roots of the rollup state posted to Layer 1
- **Deposit/Withdrawal Bridges**: Contracts that handle asset transfers between layers
- **Proof Verification**: On-chain verification of ZK proofs or fraud proofs
- **Data Publication**: Transaction data or calldata posted on-chain

For more detailed information about rollups, see:
- [Rollups](./11.03.1-scaling-layer-rollups.md)
- [ZK-Rollups](./11.06.1-scaling-layer-zk-rollups.md)

## State Channels

State channels enable direct interactions between participants without requiring each transaction to be processed by the blockchain. They are particularly effective for applications involving repeated interactions between the same parties.

### State Channel Architecture

The ProzChain State Channel Network consists of:

1. **On-Chain Components**:
   - Channel Registry Contract
   - Dispute Resolution Contract
   - Payment Hub Contracts
   - Virtual Channel Factory

2. **Off-Chain Components**:
   - State Channel Client Library
   - Channel Monitoring Service
   - Routing Network
   - Watchtower Service

### Channel Operations

State channels operate through these primary functions:

- **Channel Opening**: Lock funds in an on-chain escrow contract
- **Off-chain Transactions**: Exchange signed state updates without on-chain operations
- **Channel Closing**: Submit final state to the blockchain to distribute funds
- **Dispute Resolution**: Challenge mechanism if participants disagree on final state

### Multi-Hop Payments

ProzChain state channels support multi-hop payments through:

- **Payment Routing Algorithm**: Find optimal payment paths
- **Hash-Timelock Contracts (HTLCs)**: Enable atomic cross-channel transfers
- **Virtual Channels**: Create direct channels through intermediaries

For more detailed information about state channels, see [State Channels](./11.03.2-scaling-layer-state-channels.md).

## Sidechains

Sidechains are independent blockchains that run in parallel with the main ProzChain blockchain, with a two-way peg allowing assets to move between chains.

### Sidechain Architecture

ProzChain sidechains include:

1. **Chain Components**:
   - Independent Consensus Mechanism
   - Block Production Pipeline
   - State Database
   - Virtual Machine Environment

2. **Bridge Components**:
   - Bridge Contracts on Both Chains
   - Relay System
   - Validator Node Network
   - Proof Verification System

### Security Models

ProzChain sidechains can implement different security models:

- **Validator Threshold**: Require m-of-n validators to approve cross-chain transfers
- **Fraud Proof System**: Allow challenges for invalid state transitions
- **Optimistic Verification**: Assume validity with challenge period
- **Direct Staking**: Validators stake on the main chain for sidechain security

### Application-Specific Sidechains

ProzChain supports specialized sidechains for specific use cases:

- **High-Throughput Transaction Chains**: Optimized for payment processing
- **DeFi-Specific Chains**: Customized for financial applications
- **Gaming Chains**: Optimized for game-specific operations
- **Enterprise Sidechains**: Permissioned chains with privacy features

For more detailed information about sidechains, see [Sidechains](./11.03.3-scaling-layer-sidechains.md).

## Cross-Layer Integration

ProzChain's Layer 2 solutions are designed to work together and with the Layer 1:

### Unified Asset Model

Assets can move between layers through:

- **Standard Bridge Protocol**: Common interface for all L2<>L1 bridges
- **Asset Registry**: Tracks canonical representations across layers
- **Atomic Swap Mechanisms**: For cross-layer asset exchanges

### Cross-Layer Message Passing

Messages and calls can propagate between layers:

- **Message Tunnel Contracts**: For passing messages between layers
- **Call Forwarding**: For cross-layer contract interactions
- **Event Subscriptions**: For layer-aware event monitoring

### Unified Developer Experience

ProzChain provides tools to simplify multi-layer development:

- **Layer-Agnostic SDKs**: Abstract away layer differences
- **Transaction Routing System**: Automatically select optimal layer
- **Cross-Layer Explorer**: Unified view of all layer activities

## Layer 2 Transaction Flow

A typical transaction through a Layer 2 solution follows these steps:

1. **Submission**: User submits transaction to L2 node
2. **Execution**: Transaction is executed in the L2 environment
3. **State Update**: Local state is updated
4. **Commitment**: Transaction is included in a batch commitment
5. **L1 Submission**: Batch data or proof is submitted to Layer 1
6. **Verification**: Layer 1 verifies the submission
7. **Finalization**: Transaction is considered final per layer rules

## Economic Model

Layer 2 solutions implement their own economic models while interacting with the Layer 1 economy:

### Fee Models

- **Base Fee**: Covers L1 data posting costs
- **Execution Fee**: Covers L2 computation costs
- **Priority Fee**: Optional fee for prioritized processing

### Operator Incentives

- **Transaction Fees**: Primary revenue source
- **Staking Rewards**: Additional incentives for operators
- **MEV Capture and Distribution**: Policies for extractable value

### Security Bonds
