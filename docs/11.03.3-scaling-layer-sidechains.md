# Sidechains

## Overview

Sidechains are independent blockchain networks that run in parallel with the main ProzChain blockchain (Layer 1) and are connected to it through a two-way bridge. This structure allows assets to move between the main chain and sidechains, enabling specialized processing while maintaining a connection to the security and liquidity of the main chain.

ProzChain implements a flexible sidechain framework that allows for customizable, application-specific chains tailored to different use cases while maintaining interoperability with the main network.

## Core Concepts

### Sidechain Fundamentals

Sidechains work through the following key mechanisms:

1. **Independent Blockchain**: Each sidechain functions as a separate blockchain with its own consensus mechanism and validator set
2. **Two-Way Peg**: Assets can be transferred between the main chain and the sidechain through a cryptographically secured bridge
3. **Customized Environment**: Sidechains can implement specialized features, consensus rules, and execution environments

### Sidechain Properties

Sidechains in ProzChain have several defining characteristics:

- **Independent Consensus**: Can use different consensus mechanisms optimized for specific use cases
- **Customizable Parameters**: Block times, gas limits, and other parameters can be adjusted
- **Specialized Execution**: Can implement different virtual machines and execution environments
- **Sovereign Security Model**: Has its own validator set and security properties
- **Asset Portability**: Assets can move between chains via the bridge mechanism

## ProzChain Satellite Chains

ProzChain implements sidechains through its Satellite Chain framework, which provides:

### Bridge Mechanism

The bridge is the critical connection between chains and consists of:

#### Bridge Contracts

Two smart contracts work together to create the bridge:

1. **Main Chain Bridge Contract**:
   - Locks assets on the main chain
   - Verifies sidechain state transitions
   - Releases assets when valid withdrawal proofs are presented
   - Manages validator set changes

2. **Sidechain Bridge Contract**:
   - Mints wrapped assets on the sidechain
   - Creates withdrawal proofs
   - Verifies main chain events
   - Handles cross-chain messages

```solidity
// Simplified Main Chain Bridge Contract
contract MainChainBridge {
    mapping(address => uint256) public lockedTokens;
    mapping(bytes32 => bool) public processedWithdrawals;
    address[] public validators;
    uint256 public requiredSignatures;
    
    event Deposit(address indexed depositor, uint256 amount, bytes32 targetAddress);
    event WithdrawalProcessed(bytes32 indexed withdrawalId, address recipient, uint256 amount);
    
    // Lock tokens on main chain to mint on sidechain
    function deposit(uint256 amount, bytes32 sidechainAddress) external {
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        
        // Transfer tokens from sender to bridge
        tokenContract.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        
        // Update accounting
        lockedTokens[msg.sender] += amount;
        
        // Emit deposit event for sidechain to process
        emit Deposit(msg.sender, amount, sidechainAddress);
    }
    
    // Process withdrawal from sidechain
    function withdraw(
        bytes32 withdrawalId,
        address recipient,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes[] memory signatures
    ) external {
        // Verify withdrawal hasn't been processed
        require(!processedWithdrawals[withdrawalId], "Withdrawal already processed");
        
        // Verify signatures from validators
        require(verifySignatures(withdrawalId, recipient, amount, signatures), 
                "Invalid signatures");
        
        // Mark withdrawal as processed
        processedWithdrawals[withdrawalId] = true;
        
        // Release tokens
        tokenContract.transfer(recipient, amount);
        
        // Emit event
        emit WithdrawalProcessed(withdrawalId, recipient, amount);
    }
    
    // Verify validator signatures
    function verifySignatures(
        bytes32 withdrawalId,
        address recipient,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes[] memory signatures
    ) internal view returns (bool) {
        // Implementation logic...
    }
}
```

#### Asset Transfer Protocol

The two-way peg follows this flow:

1. **Main Chain to Sidechain (Deposit)**:
   - User locks assets in the main chain bridge contract
   - Bridge emits a deposit event
   - Sidechain validators observe the event
   - After sufficient confirmations, validators mint equivalent tokens on the sidechain
   - User receives wrapped tokens on the sidechain

2. **Sidechain to Main Chain (Withdrawal)**:
   - User burns wrapped tokens on the sidechain
   - Sidechain bridge emits a withdrawal event
   - Validators sign the withdrawal proof
   - User or relayer submits the withdrawal proof with signatures to the main chain
   - Main chain bridge verifies the proof and releases the original tokens

### Security Models

ProzChain sidechains can implement various security models:

#### Validator Set Options

1. **Independent Validators**:
   - Sidechain has its own validator set
   - Validators stake tokens specific to the sidechain
   - Can be permissioned or permissionless

2. **Main Chain Validator Subset**:
   - Some or all main chain validators also validate the sidechain
   - Leverages security of the main chain
   - Reduces validator diversity

3. **Federated Validation**:
   - Fixed set of known validators
   - Often used for enterprise or consortium chains
   - Higher throughput but more centralized

4. **Delegated Proof-of-Stake**:
   - Token holders vote for a limited set of block producers
   - Balance between decentralization and performance
   - Regular rotation of validators

#### Bridge Security

The security of the bridge is critical and protected through:

1. **Multi-signature Threshold**:
   - Requires M-of-N validator signatures
   - Tolerates up to N-M validator failures
   - Configurable threshold based on security needs

2. **Fraud Proofs**:
   - Validators can submit proofs of fraudulent activity
   - Malicious validators can be slashed
   - Economic security through staked assets

3. **Delayed Withdrawals**:
   - Major withdrawals have a time delay
   - Allows for security checks and challenge periods
   - Prevents immediate large-scale theft

4. **Adaptive Threshold**:
   - Required signature threshold changes based on value
   - Higher value transfers require more signatures
   - Improves security for large transfers

## Technical Implementation

## Security Considerations

### Trust Assumptions

Sidechains involve specific trust assumptions:
- Bridge validators control cross-chain asset flows
- Sidechain validators control state transitions
- Honest majority assumption for validator sets
- Trust in bridge contract implementation

### Bridge Vulnerabilities

Potential bridge attack vectors:
- Validator collusion attacks
- Implementation bugs in bridge contracts
- Replay attacks on deposit/withdrawal
- Network partitioning between chains

### Economic Security

Sidechain security relies on economic incentives:
- Validator staking requirements
- Slashing for malicious behavior
- Rewards for honest validation
- Economic cost of attacking the network

### Security vs. Performance Tradeoffs

Sidechains balance security with performance:
- Fewer validators improve performance but reduce security
- Faster blocks increase throughput but may increase fork rate
- Less decentralization enables more performance
- Security can be calibrated to value at risk
