# ProzChain Architecture Documentation

## 1. Overview
ProzChain is a high-performance blockchain platform written in Rust, designed specifically for enterprise-grade applications and high-throughput use cases. The architectural design prioritizes three core principles:

1. **Security**: Protection against cryptographic and consensus attacks
2. **Scalability**: Ability to handle thousands of transactions per second 
3. **Flexibility**: Adaptable to diverse industry needs

Each layer in our architecture has a distinct purpose, working in concert to process transactions, maintain data integrity, and provide interfaces to external systems. Think of the entire system as an automated factory: raw materials (transactions) enter, are verified by quality control (validation), processed in specialized departments (execution), and the finished products (state changes) are cataloged (stored) and made available for inspection (via APIs).

## 2. Technical Stack

### 2.1 Primary Language: Rust (2021 Edition)
We selected Rust for several critical reasons:
- **Memory Safety**: Rust's ownership model prevents common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and use-after-free bugs without sacrificing performance
- **Performance**: Near-C speed with zero-cost abstractions enables high throughput
- **Concurrency**: Thread safety guarantees make parallel processing safe and efficient
- **Modern Tooling**: Cargo package manager, comprehensive testing frameworks, and strong community support

*For beginners*: Imagine Rust as a strict but helpful supervisor that catches potential mistakes before they happen, ensuring the entire system remains stable even under heavy load.

### 2.2 Development Environment
- **Cargo**: Manages dependencies, builds packages, and runs tests - similar to npm for JavaScript or pip for Python
- **GitHub Actions**: Automatically tests changes before they are merged, preventing regressions
- **Docker**: Packages the entire application with its environment for consistent deployment across different systems

## 3. Architectural Layers
Our blockchain is built using a layered architecture where each component has clear responsibilities. Imagine building a house - foundation, framework, plumbing, electrical, and interior finishing all serve distinct purposes but work together to create a functional whole.

### 3.1 Core Layer
The foundation of the blockchain containing the essential building blocks:
- **Block Structure**: Templates and validation rules for blocks
- **Transaction Processing**: Basic operations for handling transactions
- **Cryptographic Primitives**: Fundamental security operations
- **Chain Management**: Basic blockchain operations like linking blocks

*Design Decision*: We separated core functionality to ensure the fundamental blockchain mechanics are isolated from higher-level features, making the system more maintainable and testable.

*Dependencies*: Uses libraries like `ring` for cryptographic primitives, `blake3` for high-performance hashing, and `ed25519-dalek` for digital signatures.

_See also:_ [Cryptography Layer](cryptography_layer.md) for detailed security mechanisms

### 3.2 Consensus Layer
Determines how agreement is reached on the blockchain state, using a hybrid mechanism combining Proof of Stake (PoS) with practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT).

*Design Decision*: This hybrid approach provides:
1. Energy efficiency compared to Proof of Work
2. Economic security through staked tokens
3. Fast finality (~2-3 seconds) unlike traditional PoS
4. Resistance to various attack vectors through validator diversity

*How It Works*: Validators must stake tokens as economic collateral, then a verifiable random function (VRF) selects block producers in a way that cannot be predicted or manipulated. The pBFT component ensures transactions are finalized quickly with formal guarantees.

### 3.3 Network Layer
Manages peer-to-peer communication between nodes in the blockchain network. It's responsible for:
- **Peer Discovery**: Finding and connecting to other nodes
- **Message Propagation**: Distributing blocks and transactions efficiently
- **Network Optimization**: Minimizing latency and bandwidth usage
- **Security**: Preventing attacks like DDoS and eclipse attacks

*Design Decision*: We implemented a modular network stack that separates Discovery, Transport, and Message handling. This allows components to evolve independently and adapt to different network conditions.

_See also:_ [Network Layer](network_layer.md) for peer-to-peer communication details

### 3.4 Storage Layer
Handles persistent data storage using specialized databases and data structures optimized for blockchain operations:
- **Block Storage**: Archives full blocks efficiently
- **State Storage**: Maintains the current world state
- **Indexing**: Enables quick lookup of blocks, transactions, and state

*Design Decision*: We use key-value databases (RocksDB/LMDB) for raw data storage and Merkle Patricia Tries for state verification, balancing performance with cryptographic integrity.

_See also:_ [Storage Layer](storage_layer.md) for data persistence details

### 3.5 Smart Contract Layer
Provides a secure sandbox environment for executing user-defined smart contracts using WebAssembly (WASM):
- **VM Execution**: Efficient containerized execution
- **Gas Metering**: Resource usage tracking and limitation
- **Contract Deployment**: Safely integrating new code
- **Contract Invocation**: Methods to interact with deployed contracts

*Design Decision*: We chose WASM over custom VMs (like Ethereum's EVM) because:
1. It's a widely adopted industry standard
2. Multiple language support (Rust, C++, AssemblyScript)
3. Performance optimization through JIT compilation
4. Security through sandboxing and formal verification options

_See also:_ [Smart Contract Layer](smart_contract_layer.md) for contract execution details

### 3.6 API Layer
Exposes blockchain functionality to external applications through standardized interfaces:
- **JSON-RPC**: Standard interface for blockchain interaction
- **GraphQL**: Flexible querying of blockchain data
- **REST API**: Resource-oriented access to blockchain data
- **WebSocket Subscriptions**: Real-time updates on blockchain events

*Design Decision*: Multiple API types serve different use cases - RPC for compatibility, GraphQL for complex queries, WebSockets for real-time applications, and REST for simple HTTP integration.

_See also:_ [API Layer](api_layer.md) for details on external interfaces

### 3.7 Security Layer
Provides comprehensive security features beyond basic cryptographic primitives:
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents denial-of-service attacks
- **Resource Isolation**: Separates execution environments for safety
- **Formal Verification**: Mathematical proving of critical code
- **Sybil Resistance**: Protection against fake identity attacks

*Design Decision*: Security is implemented as cross-cutting concerns rather than isolated features, ensuring protection at multiple levels.

_See also:_ [Security Layer](security_layer.md) for detailed protection mechanisms

### 3.8 Scaling Layer
Implements capacity improvements for higher transaction throughput:
- **On-chain Scaling**: Parallel transaction execution and sharding
- **Off-chain Scaling**: Layer 2 solutions like rollups and state channels
- **Compression**: Efficient data representation and storage
- **Aggregation**: Combining multiple operations (e.g., signature aggregation)

*Design Decision*: Multiple scaling approaches are used in concert because no single solution can address all scaling challenges - different techniques have different trade-offs.

_See also:_ [Scaling Layer](scaling_layer.md) for throughput enhancement details

### 3.9 Governance Layer
Enables on-chain decision-making and protocol upgrades:
- **Proposal Mechanism**: Structured way to suggest changes
- **Voting System**: Weighted voting based on stake
- **Parameter Adjustment**: Protocol configuration changes
- **Upgrade Coordination**: Managing network-wide updates

*Design Decision*: We chose an on-chain governance model with off-chain discussion forums to balance efficiency with community participation.

## 4. Data Flow
Understanding how data moves through the system helps visualize the blockchain's operation:

1. **Transaction Creation & Submission**:
   * A transaction is created by a client application
   * It's cryptographically signed by the sender
   * The signed transaction is submitted to the API layer

2. **Transaction Validation & Propagation**:
   * The node validates transaction syntax and signature
   * If valid, the transaction enters the mempool (pending transaction pool)
   * The transaction is propagated to peer nodes via the network layer

3. **Block Production**:
   * A validator is selected through the consensus mechanism
   * The validator picks transactions from the mempool based on gas price and other factors
   * Transactions are executed against a temporary copy of the state
   * A new block is formed with the results and signed by the validator

4. **Block Verification & Consensus**:
   * Other validators receive the block and verify its contents
   * The consensus protocol determines if the block should be accepted
   * If accepted, validators sign attestations confirming the block's validity

5. **State Update & Storage**:
   * The world state is updated by applying the transactions
   * The new block is added to the blockchain
   * Indexes are updated for efficient querying

6. **Event Emission & Notification**:
   * Events triggered by transactions are emitted
   * Subscribed clients are notified of relevant events via webhooks or WebSockets

*For beginners*: Think of this flow like a manufacturing assembly line: raw materials (transactions) enter at one end, go through quality control and processing stations (validation, execution, consensus), and emerge as finished products (confirmed state changes) that are cataloged (stored) and announced (events).

## 5. Key Processes

### 5.1 Transaction Lifecycle
The complete journey of a transaction from creation to finality:
- **Creation**: Transaction is constructed with sender, recipient, amount, data, and fees
- **Signing**: Sender's private key cryptographically authorizes the transaction
- **Submission**: Signed transaction is sent to the network
- **Validation**: Transaction is checked for correctness, sufficient funds, and proper nonce
- **Mempool Management**: Valid transaction is stored and prioritized
- **Execution**: Transaction is processed, changing account balances or contract states
- **Inclusion**: Transaction is added to a block
- **Confirmation**: Block containing the transaction achieves consensus
- **Finality**: Transaction becomes irreversible after sufficient attestations
- **Receipt Generation**: A record of the transaction's effects is created

_See also:_ [Transaction Layer](transaction_layer.md) for detailed transaction processing

### 5.2 Block Production
The process of creating new blocks:
- **Validator Selection**: Based on stake and VRF randomness
- **Transaction Collection**: Selecting transactions from the mempool
- **State Transition**: Executing transactions against current state
- **Block Assembly**: Building the complete block with header, transactions, receipts
- **Block Signing**: Cryptographically signing the block
- **Block Propagation**: Sharing the new block with the network

_See also:_ [Consensus Layer](consensus_layer.md) for block creation details

### 5.3 Consensus Process
How agreement is reached on the blockchain state:
- **Proposal**: Selected validator proposes a new block
- **Validation**: Other validators check the block's validity
- **Voting**: Validators vote on the proposed block
- **Finalization**: Block is confirmed when sufficient votes are received
- **Fork Resolution**: Any competing chains are resolved using the fork-choice rule

## 6. Performance Considerations
ProzChain is designed for enterprise-grade performance:

- **Target Block Time**: 2-3 seconds, balancing confirmation speed with network stability
- **Transaction Throughput**: Up to 10,000 TPS (transactions per second) under optimal conditions
- **Finality Time**: Less than 10 seconds for economic finality
- **Hardware Requirements**: Optimized for standard cloud hardware rather than specialized equipment
- **Concurrency**: Extensive use of parallel processing where possible

*Design Decision*: These targets were chosen to support enterprise use cases that require high throughput while maintaining decentralization. We've balanced theoretical performance with practical network limitations.

## 7. Governance and Upgradeability
ProzChain is designed to evolve over time:

- **On-chain Governance**: Token holders can propose and vote on changes
- **Parameter Adjustment**: Key protocol parameters can be modified without hard forks
- **Upgrade Mechanism**: Coordinated software updates via on-chain signaling
- **Treasury System**: Funding allocation for ongoing development

*Design Decision*: This approach balances the need for stability with the ability to adapt to changing requirements and security considerations.
