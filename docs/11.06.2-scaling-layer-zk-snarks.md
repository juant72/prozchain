# ZK-SNARKs

## Overview

Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge (ZK-SNARKs) are cryptographic proof systems that allow one party to prove to another that they know a value x, without conveying any information apart from the fact that they know the value x. In ProzChain, ZK-SNARKs serve as a fundamental building block for scaling solutions like ZK-Rollups and privacy features.

This document provides a comprehensive overview of how ZK-SNARKs are implemented in ProzChain, their technical properties, and their applications within the platform's scaling architecture.

## Core Principles

### Key Properties of ZK-SNARKs

ZK-SNARKs offer several powerful properties that make them valuable for blockchain scaling:

1. **Zero-Knowledge**: The verifier learns nothing about the witness (private inputs) beyond the validity of the statement.
2. **Succinctness**: Proofs are very small (typically a few hundred bytes) and can be verified quickly.
3. **Non-interactivity**: Proofs can be created without any interaction between the prover and verifier.
4. **Soundness**: It's computationally infeasible for a dishonest prover to create a valid proof of a false statement.
5. **Completeness**: If the statement is true, an honest prover can always generate a valid proof.

### Mathematical Foundation

ZK-SNARKs rely on several cryptographic building blocks:

1. **Elliptic Curve Pairings**: Bilinear maps that allow for efficient verification of mathematical relationships while maintaining zero-knowledge.
2. **Quadratic Arithmetic Programs (QAP)**: A way to convert computational statements into polynomial equations.
3. **Knowledge of Exponent Assumption**: A cryptographic assumption that helps ensure the soundness property.
4. **Homomorphic Hiding**: Allows computation on encrypted values without decryption.

## ZK-SNARK Architecture in ProzChain

ProzChain implements ZK-SNARKs through several integrated components:

## The SNARK Construction Process

### From Computation to Proof

The process of turning a computational statement into a ZK-SNARK involves several transformations:

1. **Problem Definition**:
   - Define the computation or statement to be proven
   - Identify public inputs, private inputs (witness), and expected outputs
   - Formalize the verification logic

2. **Circuit Construction**:
   - Express computation as an arithmetic circuit
   - Translate high-level operations to addition and multiplication gates
   - Optimize circuit structure for minimal constraints

3. **R1CS Conversion**:
   - Convert circuit to Rank-1 Constraint System
   - Express computations as quadratic constraints of form: A·x * B·x = C·x
   - Where A, B, C are matrices and x is the witness vector

4. **QAP Transformation**:
   - Convert R1CS to Quadratic Arithmetic Program
   - Represent constraints as polynomials
   - Apply interpolation to create a single polynomial identity

5. **Proof Generation**:
   - Apply cryptographic techniques to QAP
   - Use elliptic curve pairings
   - Create succinct proof of knowledge

6. **Verification**:
   - Verify the proof using efficient pairing operations
   - Fast verification regardless of computation complexity

### Example: Simple Circuit

Below is an example of a simple circuit that proves knowledge of the square root of a public value:

```
            ┌───────┐
x ─────────►│   *   │
            │  x*x  │────┐
            └───────┘    │        ┌───────┐
                         ├───────►│   =   │
                         │        │       │─────► Output (True/False)
            ┌───────┐    │        └───────┘
y ─────────►│  (y)  │────┘
            └───────┘
```

In this circuit:
- x is the private input (witness)
- y is the public input
- The circuit proves that x² = y without revealing x

## Trusted Setup Process

### Necessity of Trusted Setup

ZK-SNARKs require a one-time trusted setup phase that generates the proving and verification keys:

1. **Key Generation**: Creates structured reference string (SRS) with proving and verification keys
2. **Toxic Waste**: Process generates "toxic waste" that must be securely discarded
3. **Trust Assumption**: If toxic waste is compromised, false proofs could be generated
4. **One-time Process**: Setup is performed once per circuit but can be reused indefinitely

### Multi-Party Computation Ceremony

ProzChain mitigates trusted setup risks through a multi-party computation (MPC) ceremony:

1. **Participation**: Multiple independent parties participate in the setup
2. **Sequential Contribution**: Each participant adds randomness to the parameters
3. **Security Property**: Setup remains secure if at least one participant is honest
4. **Verification**: Contributions can be verified without compromising security
5. **Transparent Process**: Public ceremony with auditability

### ProzChain's Setup Implementation

The implementation details of ProzChain's trusted setup ceremony:

1. **Phase 1 (Powers of Tau)**:
   - Circuit-independent phase
   - Thousands of participants contribute randomness
   - Creates "universal" SRS up to a certain degree
   - Open participation with low barriers to entry

2. **Phase 2 (Circuit-Specific)**:
   - Specializes the universal SRS to specific circuits
   - Smaller group of participants (20-50)
   - Carefully selected trusted entities
   - Additional security measures for critical circuits

3. **Setup Security Measures**:
   - Airgapped computers for parameter generation
   - Open-source software for transparency
   - Physical destruction of compute equipment
   - Real-time public verification of contributions

4. **Parameter Management**:
   - Secure distribution of resulting parameters
   - Checksum verification for parameter integrity
   - Redundant storage across multiple secure locations
   - Regular auditing of parameter usage

    for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Determine which input goes on the left vs right
        selectors[i] = Selector();
        selectors[i].in[0] <== levelHashes[i];
        selectors[i].in[1] <== siblings[i];

        levelHashes[i+1] <== hashers[i].out;
    }
    
    // Final hash must match the expected root
    root === levelHashes[n];
}

component main {public [root]} = MerkleTreeCheck(20);
```

## Verification in Smart Contracts

### On-Chain Verification

        uint256[2] memory result;
        // Call to precompile would go here
        return result;
    }
    
    // Scalar multiplication on alt_bn128 curve
    function pointMul(uint256[2] memory p, uint256 s) internal view returns (uint256[2] memory) {
        // In production, this would use the precompiled contract at address 0x7
        uint256[3] memory input;
