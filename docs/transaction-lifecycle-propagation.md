# Transaction Propagation

## Overview

Transaction propagation is the process by which transactions spread throughout the ProzChain network after being accepted into a node's mempool. This critical phase ensures that transactions submitted to any node in the network can be included in blocks by validators across the network. Effective propagation balances speed, reliability, and network efficiency to maintain the overall health of the blockchain ecosystem.

This document explores the mechanisms, protocols, and optimization techniques used in ProzChain for transaction propagation, including peer-to-peer communication, propagation strategies, network topology considerations, and common challenges.

## Propagation Fundamentals

### Purpose and Goals

The key objectives of transaction propagation:

1. **Network Consistency**: Ensuring that all nodes have access to the same pending transactions
2. **Minimized Latency**: Reducing the time between transaction submission and network-wide awareness
3. **Bandwidth Efficiency**: Optimizing network resource usage through smart propagation strategies
4. **Reliability**: Guaranteeing transaction delivery despite node failures or network partitions
5. **Fairness**: Preventing censorship or preferential treatment of transactions
6. **Scalability**: Maintaining performance as network size and transaction volume grow

### Propagation Lifecycle

The journey of a transaction through the network:

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│             │     │             │     │             │     │             │
│  Local      │────►│  Direct     │────►│  Network    │────►│  Global     │
│  Acceptance │     │  Peers      │     │  Flooding   │     │  Awareness  │
│             │     │             │     │             │     │             │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
```

1. **Local Acceptance**: Transaction is validated and added to a node's mempool
2. **Direct Peers**: Node announces and shares the transaction with its direct peer connections
3. **Network Flooding**: Transaction is relayed by peers to their peers in a cascading pattern
4. **Global Awareness**: Eventually, all (or most) nodes in the network have received the transaction

### Network Topology

How the ProzChain network is structured for propagation:

1. **Peer-to-Peer Structure**:
   - Decentralized network without central coordination
   - Each node maintains connections to multiple peers
   - Dynamic peer discovery and connection management
   - Redundant pathways for resilience

2. **ProzChain Network Parameters**:
   - Default maximum outbound connections: 13
   - Default maximum inbound connections: 25
   - Target network diameter: ~4-6 hops
   - Designed for sub-second global propagation

3. **Node Types and Roles**:
   - Full nodes: Maintain complete transaction pool, relay all transactions
   - Validator nodes: Special focus on transaction collection for block production
   - Light clients: Limited propagation participation
   - Bootstrap nodes: Well-known entry points to the network

## Propagation Protocols

### Transaction Announcement

How transactions are initially advertised:

1. **Announcement Messages**:
   - Transaction hash announcement instead of full transaction
   - Batching of multiple announcements for efficiency
   - Priority flags for important transactions
   - Source tracking for propagation analytics

2. **Protocol Implementation**:

```go
// Define the transaction announcement message
type TxAnnounce struct {
    Hashes    []common.Hash // Hashes of transactions being announced
    Priority  []uint8       // Optional priority indicators
    Origin    common.Hash   // Hash identifying source (privacy-preserving)
    Timestamp uint64        // Announcement timestamp
}

// Sending transaction announcements to a peer
func (p *Peer) AnnounceTxs(txs []*types.Transaction) error {
    // Extract hashes and optional metadata
    hashes := make([]common.Hash, len(txs))
    priorities := make([]uint8, len(txs))
    
    for i, tx := range txs {
        hashes[i] = tx.Hash()
        
        // Set priority based on fee and other factors
        priorities[i] = calculatePriority(tx)
    }
    
    // Prepare and send the announcement
    announce := TxAnnounce{
        Hashes:    hashes,
        Priority:  priorities,
        Origin:    p.node.SelfOriginHash(),
        Timestamp: uint64(time.Now().Unix()),
    }
    
    return p.SendMessage(TxAnnounceMsg, announce)
}
```

3. **Announcement Policies**:
   - Rate limiting to prevent spam
   - Minimum fee threshold for propagation
   - Local vs. remote transaction differentiation
   - FIFO queuing with priority considerations

### Transaction Retrieval

How full transaction data is exchanged:

1. **Request-Response Pattern**:
   - Peers request full transactions after receiving announcements
   - Batched requests for efficiency
   - Response prioritization based on network conditions
   - Timeout and retry mechanisms

2. **Protocol Implementation**:

```go
// Define transaction request message
type TxRequest struct {
    Hashes []common.Hash // Hashes of requested transactions
    Origin common.Hash   // Request origin for tracking
}

// Define transaction response message
type TxResponse struct {
    Transactions []*types.Transaction // Full transaction data
    Missing      []common.Hash        // Hashes that couldn't be fulfilled
    Origin       common.Hash          // Response origin for tracking
}

// Handling a transaction request from a peer
func (p *Peer) HandleTxRequest(req TxRequest) error {
    // Prepare response
    resp := TxResponse{
        Transactions: make([]*types.Transaction, 0, len(req.Hashes)),
        Missing:      make([]common.Hash, 0),
        Origin:       p.node.SelfOriginHash(),
    }
    
    // Process each requested hash
    for _, hash := range req.Hashes {
        tx := p.node.TxPool.Get(hash)
        if tx != nil {
            resp.Transactions = append(resp.Transactions, tx)
        } else {
            resp.Missing = append(resp.Missing, hash)
        }
    }
    
    // Send response back to requester
    return p.SendMessage(TxResponseMsg, resp)
}
```

3. **Retrieval Optimization**:
   - Already-known transaction filtering
   - Smart request batching
   - Redundant request elimination
   - Priority-based processing queue

### Direct Propagation

Pushing transactions directly to peers:

1. **Full Transaction Push**:
   - Immediate sending of complete transaction to selected peers
   - Used for high-priority or time-sensitive transactions
   - More bandwidth-intensive but lower latency
   - Selective usage based on transaction characteristics

2. **Implementation Approach**:

```go
// Direct transaction propagation to peers
func (node *Node) PropagateTransactionsDirect(txs []*types.Transaction, maxPeers int) {
    // Select appropriate peers for direct propagation
    selectedPeers := node.selectPeersForDirectPropagation(txs, maxPeers)
    
    // Group transactions into batches for efficiency
    batches := createTxBatches(txs, MaxTxBatchSize)
    
    // Send to selected peers directly
    for _, peer := range selectedPeers {
        for _, batch := range batches {
            // Use direct propagation message
            msg := &TxDirect{
                Transactions: batch,
                Origin:       node.SelfOriginHash(),
                Direct:       true, // Flag indicating direct propagation
            }
            
            // Send async to avoid blocking
            go peer.SendMessage(TxDirectMsg, msg)
        }
    }
}
```

3. **Selective Push Strategies**:
   - High-fee transactions get broader direct propagation
   - Validator-originated transactions receive priority
   - Smart peer selection based on network position
   - Adaptive based on network congestion

## Propagation Strategies

### Gossip-Based Propagation

Network-wide dissemination through peer relaying:

1. **Gossip Protocol Fundamentals**:
   - Exponential information spreading through the network
   - Each node tells a subset of peers, who tell their peers
   - Eventually consistent with high probability of complete coverage
   - Balance between speed and redundancy

2. **ProzChain Implementation**:
   - Randomized peer subset selection
   - Dynamically sized fan-out factor
   - Anti-entropy mechanisms for consistency
   - "Eager push" for new transactions with "lazy pull" reconciliation

3. **Algorithm Pseudocode**:

```
function PropagateTransaction(transaction):
    // Determine fanout factor based on network conditions
    fanout = calculateAdaptiveFanout()
    
    // Select random subset of peers (avoiding transaction source)
    peers = selectRandomPeers(fanout, excluding=transaction.source)
    
    // Announce to selected peers
    for each peer in peers:
        sendTransactionAnnouncement(peer, transaction.hash)
    
    // Add to recently announced set to avoid redundant announcements
    recentAnnouncements.add(transaction.hash, timestamp, peers)
```

### Routing Optimization

2. **Adaptive Routing**:
   - Dynamic path selection based on current network conditions
   - Congestion-aware routing to avoid bottlenecks
   - Alternative paths for reliability
   - Feedback-based optimizations

3. **Implementation Approach**:

```go
// Select optimal peers for propagation based on various factors
func (node *Node) selectPeersForPropagation(txHash common.Hash, desiredPeerCount int) []*Peer {
    candidates := node.Peers()
    if len(candidates) <= desiredPeerCount {
        return candidates // Use all peers if we have fewer than desired
    }
    
    // Create scored list of peers
    type scoredPeer struct {
        peer  *Peer
        score float64
    }
    
    scoredPeers := make([]scoredPeer, len(candidates))
    
    for i, peer := range candidates {
        // Calculate peer score based on multiple factors
        score := 0.0
        
        // Network position score (higher for well-connected peers)
        score += peer.ConnectionCount() * 0.1
        
        // Latency score (higher for lower latency)
        score += (1000 - peer.AverageLatency().Milliseconds()) * 0.01
        
        // Geographic diversity score
        if node.isGeographicallyDiverse(peer) {
            score += 20.0
        }
        
        // Previous performance score
        score += peer.ReliabilityScore() * 5.0
        
        // Avoid peers that likely already have this transaction
        if node.peerLikelyHasTx(peer, txHash) {
            score -= 50.0
        }
        
        scoredPeers[i] = scoredPeer{peer, score}
    }
    
    // Sort by score (highest first)
    sort.Slice(scoredPeers, func(i, j int) bool {
        return scoredPeers[i].score > scoredPeers[j].score
    })
    
    // Select top scoring peers
    result := make([]*Peer, desiredPeerCount)
    for i := 0; i < desiredPeerCount; i++ {
        result[i] = scoredPeers[i].peer
    }
    
    return result
}
```

    }
    
    // If we need more peers, add best performing remaining peers
    if len(selected) < count {
        // Sort remaining peers by performance score
        remainingPeers := filterOutPeers(allPeers, selected)
        sortPeersByPerformance(remainingPeers)
        
        // Add highest scoring peers until we reach count

## Conclusion

Transaction propagation is a foundational aspect of ProzChain's peer-to-peer network, enabling the decentralized processing of transactions while maintaining consistency across the network. The propagation mechanisms balance multiple competing objectives including speed, efficiency, reliability, and fairness.

Through sophisticated gossip protocols, intelligent peer selection, and adaptive routing strategies, ProzChain achieves rapid transaction dissemination while minimizing bandwidth consumption. Advanced techniques like network coding, probabilistic forwarding, and privacy-preserving propagation further enhance the system's capabilities.

As the network continues to evolve, ongoing optimization of propagation techniques will address challenges related to scalability, network partitions, and adversarial behavior. These improvements will ensure that transaction propagation remains efficient and reliable even as network usage patterns change and transaction volumes grow.

In the next document, [Block Inclusion](./transaction-lifecycle-block-inclusion.md), we will explore how transactions are selected from the mempool and incorporated into blocks by validators.
