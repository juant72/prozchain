# Implementing a Notification Service

This tutorial guides you through building a real-time notification service that responds to blockchain events using ProzChain's WebSocket API.

## Overview

A notification service allows applications to react in real-time to blockchain events such as new blocks, transactions, or smart contract events. This enables you to build responsive applications that update automatically when relevant blockchain events occur.

## Prerequisites

- Intermediate understanding of JavaScript/Node.js
- Basic understanding of WebSockets
- Node.js (v14+) installed
- A ProzChain API key (get one from the [Developer Portal](https://developer.prozchain.com))

## Project Setup

1. Create a new directory for your project:

```bash
mkdir prozchain-notifications
cd prozchain-notifications
npm init -y
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install @prozchain/client express socket.io dotenv axios
```

3. Create basic folder structure:

```bash
mkdir public views src config
touch app.js .env
```

4. Set up environment variables in `.env`:
