# 1. Network Layer Overview

## 1.1 Purpose and Goals

The network layer of ProzChain is designed to establish and maintain the peer-to-peer (P2P) infrastructure that enables secure, reliable, and efficient communication between nodes in the blockchain network. Its key goals include:

- **Decentralization**: Creating a self-organizing network without central points of control or failure
- **Scalability**: Supporting thousands of concurrent nodes with minimal overhead
- **Security**: Protecting against various network-level attacks and ensuring data integrity

- **Peer Discovery**: Finding and connecting to other nodes in the network
- **Connection Management**: Maintaining and optimizing network connections
- **Message Propagation**: Efficiently sharing blocks, transactions, and consensus messages
- **Network Security**: Protecting against network-level attacks
- **Protocol Support**: Implementing communication protocols and data formats
- **Network Monitoring**: Collecting metrics to ensure optimal network health

## Relation to Other Layers

The Network Layer interfaces with:

- **Consensus Layer**: Distributes consensus messages and blocks
- **Transaction Layer**: Propagates pending transactions
- **Security Layer**: Implements network-level security protections
- **Cryptography Layer**: Uses cryptographic primitives for secure communication
- **Storage Layer**: Facilitates data exchange for state synchronization
