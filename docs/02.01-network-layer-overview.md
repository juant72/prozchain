# 1. Network Layer Overview

The Network Layer forms the foundation of ProzChain's distributed architecture, enabling peer-to-peer communication between nodes. It handles peer discovery, connection management, and message propagation to maintain a resilient, decentralized network.

## Why This Matters

The Network Layer is the communication backbone of the blockchain. Without a robust networking solution, even the most sophisticated consensus mechanism or transaction processing system would fail, as nodes would be unable to share information reliably or efficiently.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Peer Discovery**: Finding and connecting to other nodes in the network
- **Connection Management**: Maintaining and optimizing network connections
- **Message Propagation**: Efficiently sharing blocks, transactions, and consensus messages
- **Network Security**: Protecting against network-level attacks
- **Protocol Support**: Implementing communication protocols and data formats
- **Network Monitoring**: Collecting metrics to ensure optimal network health

## Relation to Other Layers

The Network Layer interfaces with:

- **Consensus Layer**: Distributes consensus messages and blocks
- **Transaction Layer**: Propagates pending transactions
- **Security Layer**: Implements network-level security protections
- **Cryptography Layer**: Uses cryptographic primitives for secure communication
- **Storage Layer**: Facilitates data exchange for state synchronization
