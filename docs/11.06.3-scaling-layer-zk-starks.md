# ZK-STARKs

## Overview

Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge (ZK-STARKs) are a breakthrough cryptographic proof system that enables proving the correctness of computations without revealing the inputs and without requiring a trusted setup. Unlike ZK-SNARKs, STARKs offer post-quantum security and complete transparency in their setup, which makes them particularly valuable for certain applications in ProzChain's scaling architecture.

This document describes ProzChain's implementation of ZK-STARKs, their technical properties, and their role in the platform's scaling and privacy solutions.

## Core Principles

### Key Properties of ZK-STARKs

ZK-STARKs offer several distinctive properties that differentiate them from other zero-knowledge proof systems:

1. **Transparency**: No trusted setup required, making the system fully transparent
2. **Scalability**: Proving time scales quasi-linearly with computation size
3. **Post-Quantum Security**: Based on hash functions rather than elliptic curves, providing resistance to quantum attacks
4. **Zero-Knowledge**: Optional zero-knowledge property can be enabled or disabled based on application needs
5. **Universality**: Can efficiently represent any computation expressible as an algebraic intermediate representation (AIR)

### Comparison with ZK-SNARKs

| Property | ZK-STARKs | ZK-SNARKs |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Trusted Setup | Not required | Required |
| Proof Size | Larger (10-100 KB) | Very small (~200 bytes) |
| Verification Time | Linear with input size | Constant time |
| Proving Time | Faster for large statements | Faster for small statements |
| Cryptographic Assumptions | Collision-resistant hashes | Elliptic curves, pairings |
| Quantum Resistance | Resistant | Vulnerable |
| Gas Costs | Higher | Lower |
| Maturity | Newer, evolving | More established |

## Technical Foundation

### Arithmetization

ZK-STARKs represent computations through arithmetization:

1. **Algebraic Intermediate Representation (AIR)**:
   - Express computation as polynomial constraints
   - Translate program execution into mathematical statements
   - Define transition constraints between computational steps

2. **Execution Trace**:
   - Capture entire program execution as a trace
   - Each row represents a state of the computation
   - Columns represent registers or memory values

3. **Constraint Systems**:
   - Define constraints that valid execution must satisfy
   - Boundary constraints specify input/output conditions
   - Transition constraints govern state changes

### FRI Protocol

The Fast Reed-Solomon Interactive Oracle Proof (FRI) protocol is a key component:

1. **Low-Degree Testing**:
   - Efficiently verifies that a polynomial has a degree below a certain bound
   - Uses interactive oracle proofs made non-interactive via Fiat-Shamir transform
   - Enables verifying that execution follows constraint polynomial

2. **Merkle Trees**:
   - Used to commit to polynomial evaluations
   - Enables efficient verification with random sampling
   - Provides cryptographic binding to committed values

3. **Recursive Composition**:
   - Reduces polynomial degree verification to smaller instances
   - Achieves logarithmic-sized proofs relative to computation
   - Enables scalable proofs for large computations

## The STARK Proof Generation Process

### From Computation to Proof

The process of creating a ZK-STARK follows these steps:

Steps:
1. Express hash function as algebraic constraints
