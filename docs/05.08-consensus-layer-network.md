# 8. Network Coordination

## 8.1 Time Synchronization
Mechanisms for maintaining consistent time across validator nodes.

```rust
struct TimeCoordinator {
    network_service: Arc<NetworkService>,
    peers: RwLock<HashMap<PeerId, PeerTimeInfo>>,
    time_source: TimeSource,
    time_drift_threshold: Duration,
    update_interval: Duration,
    last_sync: AtomicU64,
}

struct PeerTimeInfo {
    peer_id: PeerId,
    time_offset: i64,
    last_update: Instant,
    round_trip_time: Duration,
    reliability_score: f64,
}

enum TimeSource {
    SystemClock,
    NTP {
        servers: Vec<String>,
        last_sync: Instant,
    },
    MajorityPeers,
    Hybrid,
}

impl TimeCoordinator {
    fn new(
        network_service: Arc<NetworkService>,
        time_source: TimeSource,
        time_drift_threshold: Duration,
        update_interval: Duration,
    ) -> Self {
        TimeCoordinator {
            network_service,
            peers: RwLock::new(HashMap::new()),
            time_source,
            time_drift_threshold,
            update_interval,
            last_sync: AtomicU64::new(0),
        }
    }
    
    async fn start_sync_loop(&self) -> Result<()> {
        // ... existing code ...
    }
    
    async fn sync_with_ntp(&self, servers: &[String]) -> Result<()> {
        // ... existing code ...
    }
    
    async fn sync_with_peers(&self) -> Result<()> {
        // ... existing code ...
    }
    
    async fn check_drift_with_peers(&self) -> Result<()> {
        // ... existing code ...
    }
    
    fn apply_time_offset(&self, offset_ms: i64) {
        // ... existing code ...
    }
    
    fn get_adjusted_time(&self) -> SystemTime {
        // ... existing code ...
    }
}
```

**Design Rationale**:
- **Multiple Time Sources**: Supports system clock, NTP, peer-based, and hybrid approaches
- **Median Filtering**: Uses statistical methods to filter out outliers and attacks
- **Drift Detection**: Identifies system clock anomalies early
- **Round-trip Compensation**: Accounts for network latency in time calculations

**For Beginners**: Time synchronization in blockchain is like everyone agreeing on what time it is before making decisions. If validators have significantly different clocks, they might disagree on which blocks should be created when, causing confusion in the consensus process. This system helps keep everyone's clocks in sync by comparing with trusted time servers or with other nodes in the network.

## 8.2 Round Management
Coordination of consensus rounds and protocol phases.

```rust
struct RoundManager {
    current_height: AtomicU64,
    current_round: AtomicU32,
    round_state: RwLock<HashMap<(BlockHeight, Round), RoundState>>,
    validator_set: Arc<ValidatorSet>,
    time_coordinator: Arc<TimeCoordinator>,
    message_queue: Arc<MessageQueue>,
    timeout_config: TimeoutConfig,
    network_service: Arc<NetworkService>,
}

struct RoundState {
    height: BlockHeight,
    round: Round,
    step: ConsensusStep,
    proposal: Option<Block>,
    proposer: Address,
    votes: HashMap<VoteType, HashMap<Address, Vote>>,
    locked_value: Option<Hash256>,
    locked_round: Round,
    valid_value: Option<Hash256>,
    valid_round: Round,
    timeouts: HashMap<ConsensusStep, Instant>,
}

// ... existing code ...
```

**Design Rationale**:
- **State Machine Design**: Clearly defined steps and transitions for consensus rounds
- **Parallel Round Processing**: Capable of tracking multiple concurrent rounds
- **Timeout Management**: Dynamic timeouts to balance speed and safety
- **Vote Aggregation**: Carefully tracks votes to identify quorums

**For Beginners**: Round management is like coordinating synchronized swimmers. Everyone needs to move through each phase of consensus (proposing, voting, committing) together, with clear signals about when to transition from one step to the next. The round manager makes sure validators don't get out of sync by tracking who has done what in each round and triggering timeouts if things take too long.

## 8.3 View Changes
Handling transitions between different consensus views when leaders fail.

```rust
struct ViewChangeManager {
    current_height: AtomicU64,
    current_view: AtomicU32,
    validator_set: Arc<ValidatorSet>,
    network_service: Arc<NetworkService>,
    round_manager: Arc<RoundManager>,
    view_states: RwLock<HashMap<(BlockHeight, ViewNumber), ViewState>>,
    view_change_timeout: Duration,
    view_change_votes: RwLock<HashMap<(BlockHeight, ViewNumber), HashMap<Address, ViewChangeVote>>>,
}

struct ViewState {
    height: BlockHeight,
    view: ViewNumber,
    status: ViewStatus,
    leader: Address,
    timeout: Instant,
    new_view_sent: bool,
    view_change_reason: Option<ViewChangeReason>,
}

enum ViewStatus {
    Active,
    ViewChanging,
    Completing,
}

struct ViewChangeVote {
    height: BlockHeight,
    current_view: ViewNumber,
    new_view: ViewNumber,
    validator: Address,
    signature: Signature,
}

struct NewViewMessage {
    height: BlockHeight,
    new_view: ViewNumber,
    leader: Address,
    view_change_votes: Vec<ViewChangeVote>,
    signature: Signature,
}

enum ViewChangeReason {
    LeaderTimeout,
    InvalidProposal,
    NoProgressInView,
    ConflictingProposals,
    ExplicitRequest,
}

// ... existing code ...
```

**Design Rationale**:
- **Fault Detection**: Recognizes when the current leader is failing
- **Coordinated Transitions**: Ensures nodes switch views together
- **Vote Collection**: Aggregates view change votes for safety
- **Documentation**: Records reasons for view changes

**For Beginners**: View changes are like switching team captains during a game when the current captain isn't performing well. If a validator who's supposed to propose blocks is slow, offline, or behaving suspiciously, the view change process lets the network smoothly transfer leadership to another validator so consensus can continue without disruption.
