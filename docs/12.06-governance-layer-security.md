# Time Locks and Security

## Overview

Time locks and security mechanisms are critical components of ProzChain's governance system, protecting the protocol and its users from potential attacks while ensuring careful, deliberate governance. This document details ProzChain's implementation of time locks, security controls, attack mitigation strategies, and emergency procedures that together create a robust security framework for decentralized governance.

Time locks introduce deliberate delays between the approval and execution of governance decisions, providing opportunities for monitoring, intervention, and coordination. Combined with other security mechanisms, they create a defense-in-depth approach that increases the cost and difficulty of attacks while minimizing disruption to legitimate governance activities.

## Time Lock Fundamentals

### Time Lock Principles

Core principles guiding ProzChain's time lock implementation:

1. **Proportional Delays**: Time lock duration matches decision impact and risk
2. **Transparent Scheduling**: Clear visibility into pending execution timing
3. **Cancellation Options**: Ability to halt malicious or erroneous proposals
4. **Progressive Execution**: Phased implementation of complex changes
5. **Security Without Friction**: Balancing security with governance efficiency

### Basic Time Lock Mechanism

How the fundamental time lock works:

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│             │     │             │     │             │     │             │
│  Proposal   │────►│  Voting     │────►│  Queuing    │────►│  Execution  │
│  Creation   │     │  Period     │     │  Period     │     │  Phase      │
│             │     │             │     │             │     │             │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
                                              │
                                              ▼
                                        ┌─────────────┐
                                        │             │
                                        │  Security   │
                                        │  Review     │
                                        │             │
                                        └─────────────┘
```

1. **Queuing Period**: After approval, proposal enters the time lock queue
2. **Security Review**: During time lock, security analysis is performed
3. **Emergency Intervention**: Security issues can trigger cancellation
4. **Execution Window**: After time lock expires, execution is permitted

### Time Lock Parameters

Configuration of time lock durations:

| Proposal Type | Minimum Time Lock | Maximum Time Lock | Risk Level |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Parameter Updates | 48 hours | 7 days | Low |
| Treasury Allocations | 72 hours | 14 days | Medium |
| Protocol Upgrades | 7 days | 30 days | High |
| Governance Changes | 14 days | 30 days | Very High |
| Emergency Actions | 6 hours | 24 hours | Variable |

    // Maximum delay allowed for each proposal type
    mapping(uint8 => uint256) public maxDelays;
    
    // Queued proposal information
    struct QueuedProposal {
        bytes32 proposalId;
        address[] targets;
        uint256[] values;
        bytes[] calldatas;

            eta: eta,
            proposalType: proposalType,
            executed: false,
            cancelled: false
        });
        
        emit ProposalQueued(proposalId, eta);
    }
    
    // Execute a queued proposal after time lock expires
    function executeProposal(bytes32 proposalId) external onlyRole(EXECUTOR_ROLE) {
        QueuedProposal storage proposal = queue[proposalId];
        require(!proposal.executed, "Already executed");
        require(!proposal.cancelled, "Already cancelled");
        require(block.timestamp >= proposal.eta, "Time lock not expired");
        
        proposal.executed = true;
        
        // Execute each call in the proposal
        for (uint i = 0; i < proposal.targets.length; i++) {
            (bool success, bytes memory returnData) = proposal.targets[i].call{
                value: proposal.values[i]
            }(proposal.calldatas[i]);
            
            require(success, "Call execution failed");
        }
        
        emit ProposalExecuted(proposalId);
    }
    
    // Cancel a queued proposal
    function cancelProposal(bytes32 proposalId) external {
        require(
            hasRole(CANCELLER_ROLE, msg.sender) || 
            hasRole(EMERGENCY_ROLE, msg.sender),
            "Not authorized"
        );
        
        QueuedProposal storage proposal = queue[proposalId];
        require(!proposal.executed, "Already executed");

        proposal.cancelled = true;
        
        emit ProposalCancelled(proposalId);
    }
    
    // Get appropriate delay for proposal type
    function getDelay(uint8 proposalType) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 delay = minDelays[proposalType];
        require(delay > 0, "Invalid proposal type");
        return delay;
    }

### Security Risk Assessment

Methodology for evaluating governance security risks:

   - **Economic Risks**: Attacks exploiting economic incentives
   - **Social Risks**: Manipulation of community decision-making
   - **Operational Risks**: Failures in governance processes

2. **Risk Scoring Framework**:
   - Impact severity (1-5 scale)
   - Probability assessment (1-5 scale)
   - Risk score = Impact × Probability
   - Prioritization based on risk score

3. **Risk Management Process**:
   - Regular risk assessment meetings
   - Risk registry maintenance
   - Control implementation and testing
   - Continuous improvement cycle

### Common Governance Attack Vectors

Major attack types and their mitigations:

| Attack Vector | Description | Mitigation |
|---------------|------------|------------|
| Governance Takeover | Acquiring enough voting power to pass malicious proposals | Time locks, graduated thresholds, value-at-risk limits |
| Flash Loan Attack | Borrowing tokens to gain temporary voting power | Snapshot-based voting, voting weight history |
| Social Engineering | Misleading community to support harmful proposals | Technical review requirements, educational resources |
| Parameter Manipulation | Subtle changes to parameters with unintended consequences | Parameter bounds, simulation testing, expert review |
| Time-Sensitive Attacks | Exploiting low participation periods | Minimum quorum requirements, extended voting periods |
| Griefing | Actions that cost attackers less than victims | Proposal deposits, rate limiting, anti-spam measures |

## Conclusion

The time locks and security mechanisms embedded in ProzChain's governance layer provide essential protection against a wide range of threats while maintaining the system's usability and efficiency. Through careful design balancing security with accessibility, ProzChain's governance can accommodate broad participation while defending against malicious actors and inadvertent errors.

The defense-in-depth approach combines economic incentives, technical safeguards, and procedural controls to create multiple layers of protection. Time locks serve as a critical component of this security framework, providing crucial breathing room between decision and execution that allows for monitoring, intervention, and coordination.

As the protocol evolves, these security mechanisms will continue to adapt based on operational experience, research advancements, and changing threat landscapes. The commitment to governance security reflects ProzChain's broader dedication to building sustainable, secure decentralized systems that can support critical applications while maintaining the trust of all participants.
