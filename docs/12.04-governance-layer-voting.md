# Voting Mechanisms

## Overview

ProzChain's governance system employs several voting mechanisms, each designed for specific decision contexts and optimized for different governance objectives. This document describes the various voting systems used within ProzChain, their implementation details, security considerations, and best practices for participation. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for all stakeholders who wish to participate effectively in the protocol's governance.

## Core Voting Principles

ProzChain's voting mechanisms are built on the following fundamental principles:

1. **Representativeness**: Voting outcomes should reflect the collective will of the stakeholder community
2. **Proportionality**: Influence should generally correlate with stake in the protocol
3. **Protection Against Capture**: Mechanisms should resist centralization of power
4. **Efficiency**: Voting should reach decisions in a timely and resource-efficient manner
5. **Transparency**: All votes and processes must be verifiable and auditable
6. **Inclusivity**: Barriers to meaningful participation should be minimized
7. **Security**: Voting mechanisms must resist manipulation and attacks

## Token-Weighted Voting

### Basic Mechanism

The standard voting mechanism uses token weight as the primary measure of voting power:

1. **Vote Weight Calculation**: 
   - Basic voting power = Number of tokens held
   - Adjusted voting power = Basic power × Vote lock multiplier
   - Maximum vote lock duration: 4 years
   - Lock multiplier range: 1.0 (no lock) to 4.0 (maximum lock)

2. **Vote Options**:
   - Yes: Support for the proposal
   - No: Opposition to the proposal
   - Abstain: Neutral stance (counts for quorum but not approval)

3. **Outcome Determination**:
   - Quorum check: Total votes ≥ Minimum required participation
   - Approval check: (Yes votes) / (Yes + No votes) ≥ Approval threshold
   - Both checks must pass for proposal approval

### Implementation Details

Technical aspects of token-weighted voting:

```solidity
// Simplified implementation of vote casting
function castVote(
    uint256 proposalId,
    uint8 support, // 0=Against, 1=For, 2=Abstain
    uint256 lockDuration
) external {
    Proposal storage proposal = proposals[proposalId];
    require(block.timestamp < proposal.endTime, "Voting period over");
    
    // Calculate voting power
    uint256 userBalance = token.balanceOf(msg.sender);
    uint256 lockMultiplier = calculateLockMultiplier(lockDuration);
    uint256 votingPower = userBalance * lockMultiplier / MULTIPLIER_PRECISION;
    
    // Lock tokens if duration > 0
    if (lockDuration > 0) {
        tokenVault.lockTokens(msg.sender, userBalance, lockDuration);
    }
    
    // Record vote
    VoteReceipt storage receipt = voteReceipts[proposalId][msg.sender];
    if (receipt.hasVoted) {
        // Remove previous vote
        if (receipt.support == 0) {
            proposal.againstVotes -= receipt.votes;
        } else if (receipt.support == 1) {
            proposal.forVotes -= receipt.votes;
        } else {
            proposal.abstainVotes -= receipt.votes;
        }
    }
    
    // Add new vote
    if (support == 0) {
        proposal.againstVotes += votingPower;
    } else if (support == 1) {
        proposal.forVotes += votingPower;
    } else {
        proposal.abstainVotes += votingPower;
    }
    
    // Update receipt
    receipt.hasVoted = true;
    receipt.support = support;
    receipt.votes = votingPower;
    receipt.lockDuration = lockDuration;
    
    emit VoteCast(msg.sender, proposalId, support, votingPower);
}

// Calculate lock multiplier based on duration
function calculateLockMultiplier(uint256 lockDuration) private pure returns (uint256) {
    uint256 maxLockDuration = 4 * 365 days; // 4 years
    if (lockDuration == 0) return MULTIPLIER_PRECISION;
    if (lockDuration > maxLockDuration) lockDuration = maxLockDuration;
    
    // Linear scale from 1.0 to 4.0 based on lock duration
    return MULTIPLIER_PRECISION + (3 * MULTIPLIER_PRECISION * lockDuration) / maxLockDuration;
}
```

### Voting Power Calculation Example

Illustrating how voting power is calculated:

| Scenario | Token Balance | Lock Duration | Multiplier | Voting Power |
|----------|---------------|---------------|------------|--------------|
| No Lock | 1,000 PRZ | 0 days | 1.0× | 1,000 |
| 1-Year Lock | 1,000 PRZ | 365 days | 1.75× | 1,750 |
| 2-Year Lock | 1,000 PRZ | 730 days | 2.5× | 2,500 |
| 4-Year Lock | 1,000 PRZ | 1,460 days | 4.0× | 4,000 |

### Vote Lock Benefits and Trade-offs

The vote locking mechanism creates important incentives:

1. **Benefits**:
   - Long-term alignment of voter and protocol interests
   - Protection against governance attacks using borrowed tokens
   - Incentivizes well-considered voting decisions
   - Gives more weight to committed participants

2. **Trade-offs**:
   - Reduces capital efficiency for voters
   - May create barriers to participation for some users
   - Can lead to voter apathy if locks are perceived as too restrictive
   - Potential for vote buying through secondary markets

## Conviction Voting

### Basic Mechanism

Conviction voting is used primarily for treasury allocation decisions:

1. **Core Concept**:
   - Voting power builds up over time (conviction)
   - Proposals pass when sufficient conviction is reached
   - Larger allocations require higher conviction thresholds
   - Continuous rather than discrete voting

2. **Mathematical Model**:
   - Conviction(t) = Conviction(t-1) * decay + voting_weight
   - Decay factor (α): Typically 0.9 to 0.95
   - Threshold = base_threshold + f(proposal_size)
   - Where f() increases with requested allocation size

3. **Key Properties**:
   - No explicit voting period (continuous)
   - Multiple proposals can be supported simultaneously
   - Changing votes reduces conviction to zero
   - Proposals execute automatically when threshold reached

### Conviction Growth Model

How conviction accumulates over time:

```

└───────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Implementation Details

Technical aspects of conviction voting:

```solidity
// Simplified implementation of conviction calculation
function updateConviction(uint256 proposalId) public {
    ProposalConviction storage pc = proposalConvictions[proposalId];
    uint256 blocksPassed = block.number - pc.lastUpdate;
    
    if (blocksPassed > 0) {
        uint256 decay = calculateDecay(DECAY_FACTOR, blocksPassed);
        uint256 newConviction = (pc.conviction * decay) / PRECISION;
        
        // Add new conviction from current votes
        uint256 votingWeight = getCurrentVotingWeight(proposalId);
        pc.conviction = newConviction + votingWeight;
        pc.lastUpdate = block.number;
        
        // Check if threshold is reached
        if (pc.conviction >= getThreshold(proposalId)) {
            executeProposal(proposalId);
        }
        
        emit ConvictionUpdated(proposalId, pc.conviction);
    }
}

// Calculate decay factor based on time passed
function calculateDecay(uint256 factor, uint256 blocks) private pure returns (uint256) {
    // Exponential decay: factor^blocks
    uint256 decay = PRECISION;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < blocks; i++) {
        decay = (decay * factor) / PRECISION;
    }
    return decay;
}

// Calculate threshold based on proposal size
function getThreshold(uint256 proposalId) public view returns (uint256) {
    Proposal storage proposal = proposals[proposalId];
    uint256 requestedAmount = proposal.requestedAmount;
    uint256 totalFunds = treasury.totalFunds();
    
    // Threshold increases with requested percentage of treasury
    uint256 requestedPercentage = (requestedAmount * PRECISION) / totalFunds;
    
    // Sigmoid function to calculate threshold
    return BASE_THRESHOLD + calculateSigmoidThreshold(requestedPercentage);
}
```

### Application Examples

Scenarios demonstrating conviction voting in practice:

1. **Small Grant Request**:
   - Requested amount: 0.1% of treasury
   - Lower conviction threshold
   - Reaches execution threshold in days with moderate support
   - Minimal impact if unsuccessful

2. **Major Treasury Allocation**:
   - Requested amount: 15% of treasury
   - Very high conviction threshold
   - Requires sustained support over weeks/months
   - Significant community discussion expected

3. **Competing Proposals**:
   - Multiple proposals requesting similar resources
   - Community distributes conviction across options
   - Most favored proposal reaches threshold first
   - Natural preference revelation mechanism

## Quadratic Voting

### Basic Mechanism

Used for certain community decisions where one-token-one-vote may not be optimal:

1. **Core Concept**:
   - Voting power = Square root of tokens committed
   - Voters receive vote credits to allocate across proposals
   - Can allocate multiple votes to issues they care about
   - Cost of votes increases quadratically with number of votes

2. **Mathematical Model**:
   - Cost of n votes = n²
   - Voting power = √tokens
   - Total votes limited by vote credits allocated to voter
   - Vote credits typically proportional to √tokens held

3. **Key Properties**:
   - Reduces wealth concentration effects
   - Enables preference intensity expression
   - Requires identity verification to prevent Sybil attacks
   - Optimizes for public goods funding decisions

### Implementation Details

Technical aspects of quadratic voting:

```solidity
// Simplified quadratic voting implementation
function castQuadraticVotes(
    uint256 proposalId,
    uint256 voteCount
) external {
    // Check if user has sufficient vote credits
    uint256 voteCost = voteCount * voteCount;
    require(voteCredits[msg.sender] >= voteCost, "Insufficient vote credits");
    
    // Deduct vote credits
    voteCredits[msg.sender] -= voteCost;
    
    // Record votes
    uint256 prevVotes = userVotes[proposalId][msg.sender];
    if (prevVotes > 0) {
        proposals[proposalId].votes -= prevVotes;
    }
    
    proposals[proposalId].votes += voteCount;
    userVotes[proposalId][msg.sender] = voteCount;
    
    emit QuadraticVoteCast(msg.sender, proposalId, voteCount, voteCost);
}

// Allocate vote credits based on token holdings
function allocateVoteCredits(address user) public {
    uint256 tokenBalance = token.balanceOf(user);
    
    // Credits proportional to square root of token balance
    uint256 credits = sqrt(tokenBalance) * CREDITS_MULTIPLIER;
    
    voteCredits[user] = credits;
    emit CreditsAllocated(user, credits);
}

// Square root function using Babylonian method
function sqrt(uint256 x) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    if (x == 0) return 0;
    
    uint256 z = (x + 1) / 2;
    uint256 y = x;
    
    while (z < y) {
        y = z;
        z = (x / z + z) / 2;
    }
    
    return y;
}
```

### Utility Distribution

How quadratic voting distributes utility differently:

| Voter | Token Balance | Linear Voting Power | Quadratic Voting Power | Difference |
|-------|---------------|---------------------|------------------------|------------|
| A | 10,000 | 10,000 (83.3%) | 100 (50%) | -33.3% |
| B | 2,000 | 2,000 (16.7%) | 44.7 (22.4%) | +5.7% |
| C | 500 | 500 (4.2%) | 22.4 (11.2%) | +7.0% |
| D | 400 | 400 (3.3%) | 20 (10.0%) | +6.7% |
| E | 100 | 100 (0.8%) | 10 (5.0%) | +4.2% |
| F | 25 | 25 (0.2%) | 5 (2.5%) | +2.3% |

### Use Cases

Specific contexts where quadratic voting is most beneficial:

1. **Public Goods Funding**:
   - Funding community infrastructure
   - Supporting ecosystem development
   - Research and development initiatives
   - Protocol improvements without direct ROI

2. **Preference Signaling**:
   - Prioritizing roadmap items
   - Feature selection decisions

## Delegation System

### Delegation Mechanism

How voting power delegation works:

1. **Basic Model**:
   - Token holders can delegate voting power to representatives
   - Delegation is optional and revocable
   - Voting power is transferred but tokens remain with owner
   - Delegation can be full or partial

2. **Multi-Level Delegation**:
   - Delegations can transfer through up to 4 levels
   - Each delegation link must be explicitly established
   - Power flows from delegator to ultimate delegate
   - Loop detection prevents circular delegation

3. **Domain-Specific Delegation**:
   - Separate delegation for different proposal categories
   - Technical delegates for protocol upgrades
   - Economic delegates for treasury decisions
   - Governance delegates for meta-governance

### Implementation Details

Technical aspects of the delegation system:

```solidity
// Simplified delegation implementation
function delegate(address delegatee, uint256 domainType) external {
    // Record previous delegate to remove delegation
    address currentDelegate = delegation[msg.sender][domainType];
    
    // Update delegation mappings
    delegation[msg.sender][domainType] = delegatee;
    
    // Update delegated amounts
    uint256 amount = token.balanceOf(msg.sender);
    if (currentDelegate != address(0)) {
        delegatedPower[currentDelegate][domainType] -= amount;
    }
    
    if (delegatee != address(0)) {
        delegatedPower[delegatee][domainType] += amount;
    }
    
    emit DelegationChanged(msg.sender, currentDelegate, delegatee, domainType);
}

// Get voting power including delegations
function getVotingPower(address account, uint256 domainType) public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 ownPower = token.balanceOf(account);
    uint256 delegatedPower = delegatedPower[account][domainType];
    
    return ownPower + delegatedPower;
}

// Check for delegation loops (simplified)
function checkDelegationLoop(address delegator, address delegatee, uint256 domainType) internal view returns (bool) {
    // Maximum delegation depth
    uint256 maxDepth = 4;
    address current = delegatee;
    
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < maxDepth; i++) {
        // If we've reached a terminal delegatee or null address, no loop exists
        if (current == address(0)) return false;
        
        // If we find the original delegator, this would create a loop
        if (current == delegator) return true;
        
        // Move to the next delegatee in the chain
        current = delegation[current][domainType];
    }
    
    // If we reach max depth without finding a loop or terminal, assume there might be a loop
    return true;
}

By implementing token-weighted voting, conviction voting, and quadratic voting with a robust delegation system, the protocol enables effective collective intelligence while resisting common governance failure modes.

The careful design of these voting mechanisms creates aligned incentives for long-term participation, protects against various attack vectors, and provides the flexibility needed for the protocol to evolve. By balancing security, usability, and representativeness, ProzChain's governance system supports sustainable protocol development and stakeholder alignment.

As the protocol and its community mature, these voting mechanisms will continue to evolve, incorporating new research, stakeholder feedback, and industry best practices. This evolutionary approach ensures that ProzChain's governance remains at the forefront of decentralized decision-making, empowering its community to collectively shape the future of the protocol.
