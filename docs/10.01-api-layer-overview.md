# API Overview

## Introduction

The ProzChain API Layer serves as the primary interface between the blockchain network and external applications. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and interfaces that enable developers to build applications that interact with the ProzChain blockchain. Whether you're building a wallet, a decentralized application (dApp), a block explorer, or integrating blockchain functionality into an existing system, the API Layer provides the necessary components to make this possible.

## Design Philosophy

The ProzChain API Layer was designed with the following principles in mind:

1. **Accessibility**: Provide multiple interface types to accommodate different development needs and preferences
2. **Consistency**: Maintain uniform patterns and conventions across all interfaces
3. **Performance**: Optimize for efficient data retrieval and transaction submission
4. **Security**: Implement robust authentication and authorization controls
5. **Scalability**: Support high-volume applications with appropriate rate limiting and caching
6. **Compatibility**: Follow industry standards to facilitate easy integration with existing tools
7. **Extensibility**: Allow for future growth and feature additions

## API Interfaces

ProzChain offers four main API interfaces, each serving different use cases:

### RPC API

The JSON-RPC API provides a low-level interface for direct blockchain interaction. It follows the Ethereum-compatible JSON-RPC 2.0 specification, making it compatible with existing Ethereum tools and libraries.

Key characteristics:
- Method-based interface
- Stateless request-response model
- Compatible with standard Ethereum tooling
- Ideal for direct blockchain state access and transaction submission

### REST API

The REST API offers a resource-oriented interface following RESTful principles. It's designed to be intuitive for web developers and easily consumable by web and mobile applications.

Key characteristics:
- Resource-oriented design
- Standard HTTP methods and status codes
- Hypermedia links for resource discovery
- Ideal for web and mobile applications

### WebSocket API

The WebSocket API enables real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and the blockchain. It's essential for applications requiring instant updates on blockchain events.

Key characteristics:
- Persistent connections
- Subscription-based model
- Event-driven architecture
- Ideal for real-time applications and notifications

### GraphQL API

The GraphQL API provides a flexible query language that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. It enables complex queries in a single request, reducing bandwidth usage and improving performance.

Key characteristics:
- Client-specified data retrieval
- Strongly-typed schema
- Introspective capabilities
- Ideal for applications with complex data requirements

## Core Functionality

The API Layer provides access to all essential blockchain operations:

### Block Data

- Retrieve blocks by number or hash
- Access block headers and contents
- Get transaction lists within blocks
- Query block metadata (timestamp, validator, etc.)

### Transaction Processing

- Submit new transactions to the network
- Check transaction status and receipts
- Access transaction history
- Estimate gas costs

### Account Management

- Query account balances and nonces
- Retrieve account transaction history
- Access account storage data
- View account code (for contracts)

### Smart Contract Interaction

- Deploy new smart contracts
- Call contract read methods
- Execute contract write methods
- Listen for contract events

### Network Information

- Check network status and statistics
- Get current gas prices
- Access validator information
- View network parameters

## API Environments

ProzChain provides multiple environments to support different stages of development:

### Mainnet

The production blockchain network where real transactions and value transfers occur.
- Endpoint Base: `https://api.prozchain.com`
- WebSocket: `wss://ws.prozchain.com`
- RPC: `https://rpc.prozchain.com`
- GraphQL: `https://graphql.prozchain.com`

### Testnet

A testing environment that mimics the production network for application testing.
- Endpoint Base: `https://api.testnet.prozchain.com`
- WebSocket: `wss://ws.testnet.prozchain.com`
- RPC: `https://rpc.testnet.prozchain.com`
- GraphQL: `https://graphql.testnet.prozchain.com`

### Sandbox

A development environment for experimental features and rapid prototyping.
- Endpoint Base: `https://api.sandbox.prozchain.com`
- WebSocket: `wss://ws.sandbox.prozchain.com`
- RPC: `https://rpc.sandbox.prozchain.com`
- GraphQL: `https://graphql.sandbox.prozchain.com`

## Authentication and Security

The ProzChain API implements multiple authentication mechanisms to ensure secure access:

### API Key Authentication

Simple key-based authentication for most API operations:

```http
GET /v1/blocks/latest HTTP/1.1
Host: api.prozchain.com
X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

### JWT Token Authentication

Token-based authentication with expiration for enhanced security:

```http
GET /v1/accounts/{address}/transactions HTTP/1.1
Host: api.prozchain.com
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

### Signature-Based Authentication

Cryptographic authentication for advanced operations:

```http
POST /v1/transactions HTTP/1.1
Host: api.prozchain.com
X-ProzChain-Timestamp: 1635794236
X-ProzChain-Nonce: a1b2c3d4e5
X-ProzChain-Address: 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e
X-ProzChain-Signature: 0x7f952c857aba91256e79ba6e5eaf742e...
```
