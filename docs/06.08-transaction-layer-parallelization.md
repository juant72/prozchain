# 8. Parallelization

Transaction parallelization is a critical feature of ProzChain that enables high throughput by executing multiple transactions simultaneously. This chapter explores the techniques and systems that make parallel transaction execution possible while maintaining correctness and consistency.

## Contents

- [8.1 Dependency Analysis](./06.08.1-transaction-layer-dependency-analysis.md): Methods for identifying transaction dependencies that affect parallel execution.
- [8.2 Concurrency Models](./06.08.2-transaction-layer-concurrency-models.md): Approaches for executing transactions in parallel.
- [8.3 Execution Scheduling](./06.08.3-transaction-layer-execution-scheduling.md): Systems for efficiently scheduling transaction execution across available resources.

These sections together provide a comprehensive understanding of how ProzChain achieves scalable transaction processing through parallelization.
