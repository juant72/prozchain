# Continuous Integration

## Overview

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers frequently integrate code changes into a shared repository, followed by automated builds and tests. For blockchain applications, CI brings significant advantages including early detection of integration issues, consistent test execution, and automated deployment verifications.

This chapter explores how to set up and optimize CI pipelines specifically for testing ProzChain applications, broken down into several subcategories to address different aspects of the CI process.

## Why CI Matters for Blockchain Development

Blockchain applications require specialized CI approaches due to:

1. **Immutability**: Once deployed, smart contracts cannot be easily modified, making pre-deployment testing critical
2. **Security**: Automated security checks help identify vulnerabilities before deployment
3. **Multiple Environments**: Testing across different networks (local, testnet, mainnet)
4. **Gas Optimization**: Monitoring resource usage trends over time
5. **Integration Complexity**: Verifying interactions between on-chain and off-chain components
