## Introduction

The Security Layer provides the mechanisms and controls that ensure the ProzChain blockchain operates securely in adversarial environments. It implements defense-in-depth strategies, with multiple overlapping security mechanisms that protect against various threat vectors.

This layer cuts across all other layers of the system, providing security services to each component while maintaining a holistic security architecture. It encompasses everything from cryptographic primitives to incident response procedures.

## Key Components

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Secure identity management and access control
- **Secure Communication**: Encrypted and authenticated data transmission
- **Smart Contract Security**: Vulnerability detection and secure development practices
- **Node Security**: Protection for validator and full nodes
- **Key Management**: Safe handling of cryptographic keys
- **Auditing and Monitoring**: Detection of security events and anomalies
- **Incident Response**: Structured approach to handling security incidents

## Security Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal access rights for entities
3. **Secure by Default**: Secure configuration out of the box
4. **Fail Secure**: System remains secure even during failures
5. **Complete Mediation**: All access attempts are verified
6. **Psychological Acceptability**: Security mechanisms must be usable
7. **Open Design**: Security not dependent on obscurity
8. **Economy of Mechanism**: Simpler is more secure

## Implementation Overview

The security layer is integrated into all components of the ProzChain system, providing focused security controls appropriate to each component while maintaining a unified security architecture. The implementation uses a combination of industry-standard security libraries and custom security mechanisms designed specifically for blockchain environments.

Key security services are exposed through a clean API that allows other system components to leverage security functionality without needing to understand the underlying implementation details.
