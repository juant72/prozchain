# 9. Contract Standards

ProzChain implements and supports various contract standards to ensure interoperability, composability, and consistent behavior across the ecosystem.

## 9.1 Token Standards

Token standards define consistent interfaces for fungible and non-fungible assets:

```rust
/// Base interface for all token standards
struct TokenStandard {
    /// Standard identifier
    id: StandardId,
    
    /// Standard version
    version: SemanticVersion,
    
    /// Required functions
    required_functions: Vec<FunctionSignature>,
    
    /// Optional functions
    optional_functions: Vec<FunctionSignature>,
    
    /// Required events
    required_events: Vec<EventSignature>,
    
    /// Validation rules
    validation_rules: Vec<ValidationRule>,
}

/// Token standard types
enum TokenStandardType {
    /// Fungible token standard (similar to ERC-20)
    Fungible,
    
    /// Non-fungible token standard (similar to ERC-721)
    NonFungible,
    
    /// Semi-fungible token standard (similar to ERC-1155)
    SemiFungible,
    
    /// Soulbound token (non-transferable)
    Soulbound,
    
    /// Custom token type
    Custom(String),
}
```

### 9.1.1 Fungible Token Standard (PRC-20)

The ProzChain fungible token standard (PRC-20) is compatible with ERC-20 but with enhanced features:

```rust
/// PRC-20 Fungible Token Standard
struct PRC20Standard {
    /// Base token standard
    base: TokenStandard,
    
    /// Extensions supported
    extensions: HashSet<PRC20Extension>,
}

/// PRC-20 extensions
enum PRC20Extension {
    /// Detailed metadata
    Metadata,
    
    /// Mintable token
    Mintable,
    
    /// Burnable token
    Burnable,
    
    /// Token with supply cap
    Capped,
    
    /// Token that can be paused
    Pausable,
    
    /// Permit-style approvals (gasless)
    Permit,
    
    /// Flash minting capability
    FlashMint,
    
    /// Vote delegation
    Votes,
    
    /// Token recovery for accidental transfers
    Recovery,
    
    /// Custom extension
    Custom(String),
}

/// Interface definition for PRC-20
struct PRC20Interface {
    /// Get token name
    fn name() -> String;
    
    /// Get token symbol
    fn symbol() -> String;
    
    /// Get token decimals
    fn decimals() -> u8;
    
    /// Get total supply
    fn totalSupply() -> Balance;
    
    /// Get balance of an account
    fn balanceOf(account: Address) -> Balance;
    
    /// Transfer tokens to a recipient
    fn transfer(recipient: Address, amount: Balance) -> bool;
    
    /// Get remaining allowance
    fn allowance(owner: Address, spender: Address) -> Balance;
    
    /// Approve spender for an amount
    fn approve(spender: Address, amount: Balance) -> bool;
    
    /// Transfer from one account to another
    fn transferFrom(sender: Address, recipient: Address, amount: Balance) -> bool;
    
    /// Transfer event
    event Transfer(from: Address, to: Address, value: Balance);
    
    /// Approval event
    event Approval(owner: Address, spender: Address, value: Balance);
}
```

### 9.1.2 Non-Fungible Token Standard (PRC-721)

The ProzChain non-fungible token standard (PRC-721) is compatible with ERC-721 with additional capabilities:

```rust
/// PRC-721 Non-Fungible Token Standard
struct PRC721Standard {
    /// Base token standard
    base: TokenStandard,
    
    /// Extensions supported
    extensions: HashSet<PRC721Extension>,
}

/// PRC-721 extensions
enum PRC721Extension {
    /// Metadata (URI)
    Metadata,
    
    /// Enumerable (enumerate owned tokens)
    Enumerable,
    
    /// Mintable
    Mintable,
    
    /// Burnable
    Burnable,
    
    /// Pausable
    Pausable,
    
    /// URI storage
    URIStorage,
    
    /// Royalty support
    Royalty,
    
    /// Consecutive batch minting
    ConsecutiveBatch,
    
    /// Voting capability
    Votes,
    
    /// Custom extension
    Custom(String),
}

/// Interface definition for PRC-721
struct PRC721Interface {
    /// Balance of owner
    fn balanceOf(owner: Address) -> u256;
    
    /// Owner of token ID
    fn ownerOf(tokenId: u256) -> Address;
    
    /// Safe transfer with data
    fn safeTransferFrom(from: Address, to: Address, tokenId: u256, data: Vec<u8>);
    
    /// Safe transfer
    fn safeTransferFrom(from: Address, to: Address, tokenId: u256);
    
    /// Transfer from
    fn transferFrom(from: Address, to: Address, tokenId: u256);
    
    /// Approve operator for token
    fn approve(to: Address, tokenId: u256);
    
    /// Set approval for all
    fn setApprovalForAll(operator: Address, approved: bool);
    
    /// Get approved address for token
    fn getApproved(tokenId: u256) -> Address;
    
    /// Check if operator is approved for all
    fn isApprovedForAll(owner: Address, operator: Address) -> bool;
    
    /// Transfer event
    event Transfer(from: Address, to: Address, tokenId: u256);
    
    /// Approval event
    event Approval(owner: Address, approved: Address, tokenId: u256);
    
    /// ApprovalForAll event
    event ApprovalForAll(owner: Address, operator: Address, approved: bool);
}
```

### 9.1.3 Multi-Token Standard (PRC-1155)

The multi-token standard supports both fungible and non-fungible tokens in a single contract:

```rust
/// PRC-1155 Multi-Token Standard
struct PRC1155Standard {
    /// Base token standard
    base: TokenStandard,
    
    /// Extensions supported
    extensions: HashSet<PRC1155Extension>,
}

/// PRC-1155 extensions
enum PRC1155Extension {
    /// Metadata (URI)
    MetadataURI,
    
    /// Supply tracking
    Supply,
    
    /// Mintable
    Mintable,
    
    /// Burnable
    Burnable,
    
    /// Pausable
    Pausable,
    
    /// Royalty support
    Royalty,
    
    /// Custom extension
    Custom(String),
}

/// Interface definition for PRC-1155
struct PRC1155Interface {
    /// Batch balance query
    fn balanceOfBatch(accounts: Vec<Address>, ids: Vec<u256>) -> Vec<u256>;
    
    /// Set approval for all
    fn setApprovalForAll(operator: Address, approved: bool);
    
    /// Check if operator is approved for all
    fn isApprovedForAll(owner: Address, operator: Address) -> bool;
    
    /// Safe batch transfer
    fn safeBatchTransferFrom(
        from: Address, 
        to: Address, 
        ids: Vec<u256>, 
        amounts: Vec<u256>, 
        data: Vec<u8>
    );
    
    /// Single token balance
    fn balanceOf(account: Address, id: u256) -> u256;
    
    /// Safe transfer
    fn safeTransferFrom(
        from: Address, 
        to: Address, 
        id: u256, 
        amount: u256, 
        data: Vec<u8>
    );
    
    /// TransferSingle event
    event TransferSingle(
        operator: Address, 
        from: Address, 
        to: Address, 
        id: u256, 
        value: u256
    );
    
    /// TransferBatch event
    event TransferBatch(
        operator: Address,
        from: Address,
        to: Address,
        ids: Vec<u256>,
        values: Vec<u256>
    );
    
    /// ApprovalForAll event
    event ApprovalForAll(owner: Address, operator: Address, approved: bool);
    
    /// URI event
    event URI(value: String, id: u256);
}
```

## 9.2 Interface Standards

Interface standards define common contract interaction patterns:

```rust
/// Base interface standard
struct InterfaceStandard {
    /// Standard identifier
    id: StandardId,
    
    /// Standard version
    version: SemanticVersion,
    
    /// Required functions
    required_functions: Vec<FunctionSignature>,
    
    /// Optional functions
    optional_functions: Vec<FunctionSignature>,
    
    /// Required events
    required_events: Vec<EventSignature>,
    
    /// Required error definitions
    required_errors: Vec<ErrorDefinition>,
}
```

### 9.2.1 Interface Detection (PRC-165)

The interface detection standard allows contracts to declare which interfaces they support:

```rust
/// PRC-165 Interface Detection Standard
struct PRC165Standard {
    /// Base interface standard
    base: InterfaceStandard,
}

/// Interface definition for PRC-165
struct PRC165Interface {
    /// Supports interface check
    fn supportsInterface(interfaceId: bytes4) -> bool;
}
```

### 9.2.2 Proxy Standard (PRC-1967)

The proxy standard defines transparent proxies for upgradeable contracts:

```rust
/// PRC-1967 Proxy Standard
struct PRC1967Standard {
    /// Base interface standard
    base: InterfaceStandard,
}

/// Interface definition for PRC-1967
struct PRC1967Interface {
    /// Implementation slot
    bytes32 IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT = 0x360894a13ba1a3210667c828492db98dca3e2076cc3735a920a3ca505d382bbc;
    
    /// Admin slot
    bytes32 ADMIN_SLOT = 0xb53127684a568b3173ae13b9f8a6016e243e63b6e8ee1178d6a717850b5d6103;
    
    /// Beacon slot
    bytes32 BEACON_SLOT = 0xa3f0ad74e5423aebfd80d3ef4346578335a9a72aeaee59ff6cb3582b35133d50;
    
    /// Upgraded event
    event Upgraded(implementation: Address);
    
    /// AdminChanged event
    event AdminChanged(previousAdmin: Address, newAdmin: Address);
    
    /// BeaconUpgraded event
    event BeaconUpgraded(beacon: Address);
}
```

### 9.2.3 Registry Interface (PRC-5600)

The registry interface standard defines consistent registration and lookup patterns:

```rust
/// PRC-5600 Registry Interface Standard
struct PRC5600Standard {
    /// Base interface standard
    base: InterfaceStandard,
}

/// Interface definition for PRC-5600
struct PRC5600Interface {
    /// Register entry
    fn register(name: String, target: Address, metadata: Vec<u8>) -> u256;
    
    /// Deregister entry
    fn deregister(id: u256);
    
    /// Update entry
    fn update(id: u256, target: Address, metadata: Vec<u8>);
    
    /// Resolve name to entry
    fn resolve(name: String) -> (Address, Vec<u8>);
    
    /// Get entry by ID
    fn getEntry(id: u256) -> (String, Address, Vec<u8>);
    
    /// Check if entry exists
    fn exists(name: String) -> bool;
    
    /// Get entries for owner
    fn entriesOf(owner: Address) -> Vec<u256>;
    
    /// Transfer entry ownership
    fn transferFrom(from: Address, to: Address, id: u256);
    
    /// Entry registered event
    event EntryRegistered(id: u256, name: String, target: Address, owner: Address);
    
    /// Entry updated event
    event EntryUpdated(id: u256, target: Address, metadata: Vec<u8>);
    
    /// Entry deregistered event
    event EntryDeregistered(id: u256);
    
    /// Entry transferred event
    event EntryTransferred(id: u256, from: Address, to: Address);
}
```

## 9.3 Governance Standards

Governance standards define how contracts handle decentralized decision-making:

```rust
/// Base governance standard
struct GovernanceStandard {
    /// Standard identifier
    id: StandardId,
    
    /// Standard version
    version: SemanticVersion,
    
    /// Required functions
    required_functions: Vec<FunctionSignature>,
    
    /// Optional functions
    optional_functions: Vec<FunctionSignature>,
    
    /// Required events
    required_events: Vec<EventSignature>,
    
    /// Governance model type
    model_type: GovernanceModelType,
}

/// Types of governance models
enum GovernanceModelType {
    /// Token-based voting
    TokenBased,
    
    /// Multisig governance
    Multisig,
    
    /// Quadratic voting
    Quadratic,
    
    /// Timelocked governance
    Timelocked,
    
    /// Custom model
    Custom(String),
}
```

### 9.3.1 Governor Standard (PRC-40000)

The governor standard defines contract-based governance systems:

```rust
/// PRC-40000 Governor Standard
struct PRC40000Standard {
    /// Base governance standard
    base: GovernanceStandard,
    
    /// Extensions supported
    extensions: HashSet<GovernorExtension>,
}

/// Governor extensions
enum GovernorExtension {
    /// Vote counting with multiple options
    Counting,
    
    /// Timelock control
    Timelock,
    
    /// Support for ERC-721 voting
    NFTVoting,
    
    /// Quorum calculation from past events
    QuorumHistory,
    
    /// Settings managed on-chain
    Settings,
    
    /// Custom extension
    Custom(String),
}

/// Interface definition for PRC-40000
struct PRC40000Interface {
    /// Get proposal ID from proposal details
    fn hashProposal(
        targets: Vec<Address>, 
        values: Vec<u256>, 
        calldatas: Vec<Vec<u8>>,
        description_hash: bytes32
    ) -> u256;
    
    /// Get proposal state
    fn state(proposalId: u256) -> ProposalState;
    
    /// Propose new actions
    fn propose(
        targets: Vec<Address>, 
        values: Vec<u256>, 
        calldatas: Vec<Vec<u8>>,
        description: String
    ) -> u256;

        values: Vec<u256>, 
        calldatas: Vec<Vec<u8>>,
        description_hash: bytes32
    ) -> u256;
    
    /// Cast vote on proposal
    fn castVote(proposalId: u256, support: u8) -> u256;
    
    /// Cast vote with reason
    fn castVoteWithReason(proposalId: u256, support: u8, reason: String) -> u256;
    
    /// Cast vote with signature
    fn castVoteWithSignature(
        proposalId: u256, 
        support: u8, 
        signature: Vec<u8>
    ) -> u256;
    
    /// Get voting power at block
    fn getVotes(account: Address, blockNumber: u64) -> u256;
    
    /// Check if proposal is queued
    fn proposalQueued(proposalId: u256) -> bool;
    
    /// Get voting period in blocks
    fn votingPeriod() -> u64;
    
    /// Get voting delay in blocks
    fn votingDelay() -> u64;
    
    /// Get quorum at block
    fn quorum(blockNumber: u64) -> u256;
    
    /// Proposal created event
    event ProposalCreated(
        proposalId: u256,
        proposer: Address,
        targets: Vec<Address>,
        values: Vec<u256>,
        signatures: Vec<String>,
        calldatas: Vec<Vec<u8>>,
        startBlock: u64,
        endBlock: u64,
        description: String
    );
    
    /// Vote cast event
    event VoteCast(
        voter: Address,
        proposalId: u256,
        support: u8,
        weight: u256,
        reason: String
    );
    
    /// Proposal state enum
    enum ProposalState {
        Pending,
        Active,
        Canceled,
        Defeated,
        Succeeded,
        Queued,
        Expired,
        Executed
    }
}
```

### 9.3.2 Multisignature Wallet Standard (PRC-40100)

The multisig standard defines secure multi-party contract control:

```rust
/// PRC-40100 Multisignature Wallet Standard
struct PRC40100Standard {
    /// Base governance standard
    base: GovernanceStandard,
}

/// Interface definition for PRC-40100
struct PRC40100Interface {
    /// Submit transaction
    fn submitTransaction(
        to: Address, 
        value: u256, 
        data: Vec<u8>
    ) -> u256;
    
    /// Confirm transaction
    fn confirmTransaction(transactionId: u256);
    
    /// Revoke confirmation
    fn revokeConfirmation(transactionId: u256);
    
    /// Execute transaction
    fn executeTransaction(transactionId: u256) -> bool;
    
    /// Check if transaction confirmed
    fn isConfirmed(transactionId: u256) -> bool;
    
    /// Get confirmation count
    fn getConfirmationCount(transactionId: u256) -> u256;
    
    /// Get transaction count
    fn getTransactionCount(pending: bool, executed: bool) -> u256;
    
    /// Get owners
    fn getOwners() -> Vec<Address>;
    
    /// Get confirmations
    fn getConfirmations(transactionId: u256) -> Vec<Address>;
    
    /// Get transaction
    fn getTransaction(
        transactionId: u256
    ) -> (Address, u256, Vec<u8>, bool);
    
    /// Check if address is owner
    fn isOwner(owner: Address) -> bool;
    
    /// Get required confirmations
    fn required() -> u256;
    
    /// Confirmation event
    event Confirmation(sender: Address, transactionId: u256);
    
    /// Revocation event
    event Revocation(sender: Address, transactionId: u256);
    
    /// Submission event
    event Submission(transactionId: u256);
    
    /// Execution event
    event Execution(transactionId: u256);

    /// Owner removal event
    event OwnerRemoval(owner: Address);
    
    /// Requirement change event
    event RequirementChange(required: u256);
}
```

## 9.4 Metadata Standards

Metadata standards ensure consistent off-chain data linking:

```rust
/// Base metadata standard
struct MetadataStandard {
    /// Standard identifier
    id: StandardId,
    
    /// Standard version
    version: SemanticVersion,
    
    /// Required fields
    required_fields: Vec<MetadataField>,
    
    /// Optional fields
    optional_fields: Vec<MetadataField>,
    
    /// Validation rules
    validation_rules: Vec<ValidationRule>,
}

/// Metadata field definition
struct MetadataField {
    /// Field name
    name: String,
    
    /// Field data type
    data_type: MetadataType,
    
    /// Field description
    description: String,
    
    /// Example value
    example: Option<Value>,
}

/// Metadata types
enum MetadataType {
    String,
    Number,
    Boolean,
    Object,
    Array(Box<MetadataType>),
    Enum(Vec<String>),
    Uri,
    Image,
    Date,
    Custom(String),
}
```

### 9.4.1 JSON Metadata Standard (PRC-1155)

Standard format for token metadata as JSON:

```rust
/// PRC-1155 JSON Metadata Standard 
struct PRC1155MetadataStandard {
    /// Base metadata standard
    base: MetadataStandard,
}

/// Example PRC-1155 metadata JSON
struct PRC1155MetadataExample {
    /// Token name
    name: String,
    
    /// Token description
    description: String,
    
    /// Token image URI
    image: String,
    
    /// External URL
    external_url: Option<String>,
    
    /// Token properties
    properties: HashMap<String, Value>,
    
    /// Localization
    localization: Option<Localization>,
}

/// Localization information
struct Localization {
    /// Default locale
    default: String,
    
    /// Localized data URI
    uri: String,
    
    /// Supported locales
    locales: Vec<String>,
}
```

### 9.4.2 Contract Metadata Standard (PRC-7000)

Standard for contract-level metadata:

```rust
/// PRC-7000 Contract Metadata Standard
struct PRC7000Standard {
    /// Base metadata standard
    base: MetadataStandard,
}

/// Contract metadata example
struct ContractMetadataExample {
    /// Contract name
    name: String,
    
    /// Contract version
    version: String,
    
    /// Contract description
    description: String,
    
    /// Contract license
    license: String,
    
    /// Author information
    author: Author,
    
    /// Contract source information
    source: Source,
    
    /// Contract website
    website: Option<String>,
    
    /// Social media links
    social: HashMap<String, String>,
    
    /// Logo/Icon URI
    logo: Option<String>,
    
    /// Supported standards
    standards: Vec<String>,
    
    /// Implementation details
    implementation: Option<Implementation>,
}

/// Author information
struct Author {
    /// Author name
    name: String,
    
    /// Author URL
    url: Option<String>,
    
    /// Author email
    email: Option<String>,
}

/// Source code information
struct Source {
    /// Code repository
    repository: Option<String>,
    
    /// Specific commit hash
    commit: Option<String>,
    
    /// Verification service link
    verification: Option<String>,
}

/// Implementation details
struct Implementation {
    /// Programming language
    language: String,
    
    /// Compiler version
    compiler_version: String,
    
    /// Compiler settings
    compiler_settings: Option<Value>,
    
    /// Framework used
    framework: Option<String>,
}
```

## 9.5 Implementation Reference Library

ProzChain provides a standard library of reference implementations for all contract standards:

```rust
/// Standard implementation library
struct StandardImplementationLibrary {
    /// Token standards
    token_standards: HashMap<StandardId, Vec<ImplementationReference>>,
    
    /// Interface standards
    interface_standards: HashMap<StandardId, Vec<ImplementationReference>>,
    
    /// Governance standards

**Design Rationale**:
- **Interoperability**: Standards ensure contracts can work together seamlessly
- **Ethereum Compatibility**: Many standards are compatible with Ethereum standards
- **Enhanced Functionality**: ProzChain standards build on existing standards with added features
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Standards for tokens, interfaces, governance and metadata
- **Reference Implementations**: Well-tested implementations reduce development effort

**For Beginners**: Contract standards are like blueprint templates that help developers create smart contracts that can easily work together. For example, if you create a token using the PRC-20 standard, it will be compatible with any wallet or exchange that supports that standard. These standards make it much easier to build composable applications where different contracts can interact smoothly. They also help ensure security by providing well-tested patterns for common functionalities.
