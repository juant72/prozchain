# Storage Layer Documentation

## 1. Overview
The Storage Layer is responsible for the persistent storage of blockchain data, ensuring durability, consistency, and efficient access patterns. This foundational layer handles how blocks, transactions, account state, and auxiliary indexes are stored and retrieved, serving the needs of higher-level components.

**Why This Matters**: Without efficient and reliable storage mechanisms, blockchain performance would degrade rapidly as the chain grows. Our carefully designed storage architecture ensures consistently fast access regardless of blockchain size.

## 2. Storage Architecture

### 2.1 Database Selection and Design
ProzChain employs a hybrid storage approach to optimize for different data access patterns.

**Key Database Components**:
- **Key-Value Store (RocksDB/LMDB)**: For raw blockchain data (blocks, transactions)
- **Merkle Patricia Trie**: For state storage with cryptographic verification
- **Column Family Organization**: Logical separation of data types

**Implementation Example**:
```rust
struct BlockchainStorage {
    block_store: ColumnFamily,
    transaction_store: ColumnFamily,
    receipt_store: ColumnFamily,
    state_store: ColumnFamily,
    metadata_store: ColumnFamily,
    db_backend: Arc<RocksDB>,
}

impl BlockchainStorage {
    fn new(db_path: &Path, config: StorageConfig) -> Result<Self> {
        // Initialize database with proper column families
        // Configure options for each column family based on access patterns
        // Set up compaction and caching policies
        // ...existing code...
    }
}
```

**Design Rationale**:
- **LSM-Tree Based Storage**: Optimizes for write-heavy workloads (RocksDB)
- **Column Families**: Separates data with different access patterns
- **Tiered Storage**: Hot data in memory/SSD, cold data potentially on HDD
- **Tuned Compaction**: Balances write amplification with read performance

**For Beginners**: Think of this like organizing a library - books (data) are categorized and shelved (different databases) in ways that make them easiest to find based on how frequently they're accessed and what information people typically want.

### 2.2 Data Schema
Carefully designed data structures ensure efficient storage and retrieval.

**Core Data Types**:
- **Blocks**: Complete blocks with headers and transaction lists
- **Transactions**: Individual transactions with metadata
- **Receipts**: Transaction execution results and events
- **State**: Current world state (account balances, contract storage)
- **Indexes**: Helper structures for quick lookups

**Key-Value Mapping Examples**:
```rust
fn store_block(&self, block: &Block) -> Result<()> {
    let block_key = format!("block:{}", block.header.hash());
    let block_value = serialize(block)?;
    self.db_backend.put(block_key, block_value)?;
    Ok(())
}

fn get_block(&self, block_hash: &str) -> Result<Block> {
    let block_key = format!("block:{}", block_hash);
    let block_value = self.db_backend.get(block_key)?;
    let block: Block = deserialize(&block_value)?;
    Ok(block)
}
```

**Design Rationale**:
- **Efficient Serialization**: Minimizes storage space and speeds up access
- **Consistent Hashing**: Ensures unique and predictable keys
- **Separation of Concerns**: Different data types stored in separate column families

**For Beginners**: Imagine each type of data (blocks, transactions) has its own section in the library, and each item is labeled with a unique identifier (hash) to make it easy to find.

## 3. State Storage

### 3.1 Merkle Patricia Trie
The Merkle Patricia Trie (MPT) is used for state storage, providing efficient and cryptographically secure verification of state changes.

**Key Features**:
- **Efficient Updates**: Only modified parts of the trie are updated
- **Cryptographic Integrity**: Each node's hash depends on its children, ensuring tamper-evidence
- **Compact Proofs**: Enables efficient state proofs for light clients

**Implementation Example**:
```rust
struct MerklePatriciaTrie {
    root: NodeHandle,
    db: Arc<RocksDB>,
}

impl MerklePatriciaTrie {
    fn insert(&mut self, key: &[u8], value: &[u8]) -> Result<()> {
        // Insert key-value pair into the trie
        // Update affected nodes and recompute hashes
        // ...existing code...
    }

    fn get(&self, key: &[u8]) -> Result<Option<Vec<u8>>> {
        // Retrieve value associated with the key
        // Traverse the trie from the root
        // ...existing code...
    }
}
```

**Design Rationale**:
- **Sparse Representation**: Efficiently handles large state spaces with many empty entries
- **Immutable Snapshots**: Enables historical state queries and forks
- **Proof Generation**: Supports light client verification and cross-chain communication

**For Beginners**: Think of the MPT as a tree where each branch leads to a piece of data, and every branch's label (hash) changes if any data below it changes, making it easy to detect tampering.

## 4. Indexing and Query Optimization

### 4.1 Index Structures
Indexes are used to speed up queries for blocks, transactions, and state.

**Key Index Types**:
- **Block Index**: Maps block hashes to block heights
- **Transaction Index**: Maps transaction hashes to block hashes and positions
- **State Index**: Maps account addresses to state roots

**Implementation Example**:
```rust
struct Indexes {
    block_index: HashMap<BlockHash, BlockHeight>,
    transaction_index: HashMap<TransactionHash, (BlockHash, usize)>,
    state_index: HashMap<Address, StateRoot>,
}

impl Indexes {
    fn add_block(&mut self, block: &Block) {
        self.block_index.insert(block.header.hash(), block.header.height);
        for (i, tx) in block.transactions.iter().enumerate() {
            self.transaction_index.insert(tx.hash(), (block.header.hash(), i));
        }
    }

    fn get_block_height(&self, block_hash: &BlockHash) -> Option<BlockHeight> {
        self.block_index.get(block_hash).cloned()
    }

    fn get_transaction_location(&self, tx_hash: &TransactionHash) -> Option<(BlockHash, usize)> {
        self.transaction_index.get(tx_hash).cloned()
    }
}
```

**Design Rationale**:
- **Fast Lookups**: Reduces query time for common operations
- **Memory Efficiency**: Uses compact data structures to minimize memory usage
- **Consistency**: Ensures indexes are updated atomically with the main data

**For Beginners**: Indexes are like the index at the back of a book, helping you quickly find the page (block) where a specific topic (transaction) is discussed.

## 5. Performance Optimization

### 5.1 Caching Strategies
Caches are used to speed up access to frequently accessed data.

**Key Cache Types**:
- **Block Cache**: Stores recently accessed blocks
- **State Cache**: Stores recently accessed state entries
- **Transaction Cache**: Stores recently accessed transactions

**Implementation Example**:
```rust
struct Cache<K, V> {
    map: LruCache<K, V>,
}

impl<K, V> Cache<K, V> {
    fn new(capacity: usize) -> Self {
        Cache {
            map: LruCache::new(capacity),
        }
    }

    fn get(&mut self, key: &K) -> Option<&V> {
        self.map.get(key)
    }

    fn put(&mut self, key: K, value: V) {
        self.map.put(key, value);
    }
}
```

**Design Rationale**:
- **LRU Policy**: Ensures the most frequently accessed data stays in cache
- **Configurable Size**: Allows tuning based on available memory and workload
- **Thread Safety**: Ensures safe concurrent access in a multi-threaded environment

**For Beginners**: Caches are like keeping frequently used items on your desk instead of in a drawer, so you can access them quickly without searching.

### 5.2 Compaction and Garbage Collection
Periodic compaction and garbage collection ensure efficient use of storage space.

**Key Techniques**:
- **Log-Structured Merge (LSM) Trees**: Periodically merge and compact data
- **Garbage Collection**: Reclaims space from deleted or outdated entries
- **Snapshotting**: Creates consistent views of the database for backup and recovery

**Implementation Example**:
```rust
impl BlockchainStorage {
    fn compact(&self) -> Result<()> {
        // Trigger compaction for all column families
        // ...existing code...
    }

    fn garbage_collect(&self) -> Result<()> {
        // Identify and remove stale data
        // ...existing code...
    }
}
```

**Design Rationale**:
- **Space Efficiency**: Reduces storage overhead and fragmentation
- **Performance**: Maintains consistent read and write performance
- **Reliability**: Ensures data integrity and recoverability

**For Beginners**: Compaction is like cleaning and organizing your desk periodically to make sure everything is in order and you have enough space to work efficiently.

## 6. Security Considerations

### 6.1 Data Integrity
Ensuring the integrity of stored data is critical for blockchain security.

**Key Techniques**:
- **Cryptographic Hashing**: Verifies data integrity using hashes
- **Merkle Proofs**: Provides cryptographic proofs of data inclusion
- **Consistency Checks**: Periodically verifies the consistency of stored data

**Implementation Example**:
```rust
fn verify_data_integrity(&self, key: &str, expected_hash: &str) -> Result<bool> {
    let data = self.db_backend.get(key)?;
    let actual_hash = blake3::hash(&data).to_hex();
    Ok(actual_hash == expected_hash)
}

fn generate_merkle_proof(&self, key: &str) -> Result<MerkleProof> {
    // Generate a Merkle proof for the given key
    // ...existing code...
}
```

**Design Rationale**:
- **Tamper-Evidence**: Detects any unauthorized modifications to data
- **Proof Generation**: Enables efficient verification of data by light clients
- **Periodic Audits**: Ensures ongoing data integrity and consistency

**For Beginners**: Data integrity checks are like regularly verifying that important documents haven't been altered or tampered with.

### 6.2 Access Control
Controlling access to stored data is essential for security and privacy.

**Key Techniques**:
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Restricts access based on user roles
- **Encryption**: Protects sensitive data at rest and in transit
- **Audit Logging**: Records access and modification events for accountability

**Implementation Example**:
```rust
struct AccessControl {
    roles: HashMap<UserId, Role>,
    permissions: HashMap<Role, Vec<Permission>>,
}

impl AccessControl {
    fn check_permission(&self, user_id: &UserId, permission: &Permission) -> Result<bool> {
        let role = self.roles.get(user_id).ok_or(Error::Unauthorized)?;
        let permissions = self.permissions.get(role).ok_or(Error::Unauthorized)?;
        Ok(permissions.contains(permission))
    }
}
```

**Design Rationale**:
- **Least Privilege**: Minimizes access to only what is necessary
- **Encryption**: Ensures data confidentiality and integrity
- **Accountability**: Tracks and audits access to sensitive data

**For Beginners**: Access control is like having locks on your drawers and only giving keys to people who need them, while also keeping a log of who accessed what and when.
