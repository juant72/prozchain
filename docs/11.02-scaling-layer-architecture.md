# Scaling Architecture

## Overview

The ProzChain scaling architecture consists of multiple interconnected layers and components designed to work together to achieve high scalability while maintaining security and decentralization. This document outlines the architectural design of ProzChain's scaling infrastructure, the interaction between different scaling solutions, and the technical foundations that enable these components to work together.

## System Architecture

ProzChain's scaling architecture follows a multi-layered approach:

### Core Components

#### 1. Settlement Layer (L1)

The foundation of the scaling architecture is the settlement layer, which provides ultimate security and finality:

- **Consensus Layer**: Operates using a hybrid PoS consensus with high security guarantees
- **Data Availability Layer**: Ensures all transaction data is available to validators
- **Execution Layer**: Processes transactions and updates the global state
- **Sharding System**: Divides processing into parallel shards for horizontally scaled throughput

The settlement layer acts as the trust anchor for all higher layers, providing:
- Final settlement for Layer 2 systems
- Dispute resolution for optimistic systems
- Verification of cryptographic proofs

#### 2. Layer 2 Systems

Multiple Layer 2 scaling solutions operate above the settlement layer:

- **Rollup Networks**
  - Process transactions off-chain
  - Submit compressed batches and proofs to the settlement layer
  - Inherit security from the settlement layer

- **State Channels**
  - Enable direct off-chain transactions between parties
  - Require on-chain operations only for channel opening/closing
  - Suitable for frequent interactions between specific parties

- **Sidechain Networks**
  - Operate separate consensus mechanisms
  - Connect to the main settlement layer via bridges
  - Optimize for specific use cases (e.g., gaming, DeFi)

#### 3. Bridge Layer

The bridge layer manages secure communication between different components:

- **Cross-Chain Communication**: Secure messaging between sidechains and the main chain
- **Rollup Integration**: Management of state transitions between rollups and L1
- **State Channel Hub**: Efficient channel management and routing

#### 4. Unified API Layer

The API layer provides a consistent interface for applications:

- **Abstraction**: Hides complexity of different scaling solutions
- **Routing**: Intelligently routes transactions to the optimal scaling solution
- **Developer Tools**: SDKs and tools for building on any layer

## Interaction Between Components

### Transaction Flow

The path of a typical transaction through the architecture:

1. **User Initiation**: Application submits transaction via Unified API
2. **Route Selection**: System determines optimal execution layer based on:
   - Transaction type
   - Cost requirements
   - Speed requirements
   - Security requirements

3. **Execution Options**:
   - Direct L1 execution for critical or complex transactions
   - Rollup execution for standard transactions requiring security
   - State channel execution for repeated interactions between parties
   - Sidechain execution for specialized application requirements

4. **Finalization**: 
   - L1 transactions: Finalized through consensus
   - Rollup transactions: Batch verification and commitment on L1
   - State channel transactions: Off-chain finality with on-chain dispute option
   - Sidechain transactions: Sidechain consensus with periodic L1 checkpoints

### Cross-Layer Communication

Communication between different scaling layers follows these patterns:

1. **Rollup to L1**: 
   - Periodic batch submissions with state transitions
   - Merkle proof verification
   - Optional fraud-proof challenge period

2. **State Channel to L1**:
   - Opening transactions create on-chain escrow
   - Closing transactions settle final state
   - Dispute transactions resolve conflicts

3. **Sidechain to L1**:
   - Periodic checkpoints of sidechain state
   - Two-way bridge for asset transfers
   - Optional fraud proofs for additional security

4. **Cross-shard Communication**:
   - Asynchronous message passing
   - Receipt-based verification
   - Atomic composability within predefined domains

## State Management

Each component manages state differently:

### L1 State Management

- **Global State**: Full EVM-compatible state with account balances and contract storage
- **Sharding**: State partitioned across shards with cross-shard lookup protocols
- **Availability**: Full data availability guarantees through consensus

### Rollup State Management

- **Off-chain State**: Maintained by rollup operators
- **State Commitments**: Merkle roots stored on L1
- **Data Availability**: Transaction data published on-chain or to DA committees

### State Channel State Management

- **Channel State**: Maintained privately between participants
- **State Updates**: Signed state transitions exchanged directly
- **Settlement**: Latest valid state enforceable on L1

### Sidechain State Management

- **Independent State**: Maintained within the sidechain
- **Checkpoints**: Periodic state root commitments to L1
- **Bridge State**: Special contracts managing cross-chain assets

## Security Model

The scaling architecture employs a multi-layered security approach:

1. **Settlement Layer Security**:
   - Economic security through validator stakes
   - Cryptographic security through consensus algorithms
   - Data availability guarantees for verifiability

2. **Rollup Security**:
   - Optimistic Rollups: Fraud-proof mechanism with challenge period
   - ZK Rollups: Cryptographic verification of state transitions
   - Economic: Bond requirements for operators

3. **State Channel Security**:
   - Cryptographic: Multi-signature validation
   - Game-theoretic: Rational behavior incentives
   - Timeout: Time-bound dispute resolution

4. **Sidechain Security**:
   - Independent consensus mechanisms
   - Economic: Validator incentives
   - Bridge security: Multi-signature and/or threshold cryptography

5. **Cross-layer Security**:
   - Clean separation of security domains
   - Explicit trust assumptions at boundaries
   - Principle of least privilege for cross-domain operations

## Scalability Characteristics

The architecture achieves scalability through multiple mechanisms:

1. **Horizontal Scalability**:
   - Sharding: Parallel transaction processing across shards
   - Multiple L2 networks: Independent execution environments
   - State channels: Peer-to-peer scalability

2. **Vertical Scalability**:
   - Batching: Amortizing fixed costs across multiple transactions
   - Compression: Reducing data footprint per transaction
   - Specialized hardware: Acceleration of cryptographic operations

3. **Economic Scalability**:
   - Fee markets at each layer
   - Resource pricing reflecting true costs
   - Incentive alignment for operators and users

## Performance Characteristics

Expected performance metrics for each component:

| Component | TPS | Latency | Finality | Cost |
|-----------|-----|---------|----------|------|
| L1 (per shard) | 1,000 | 2-5s | 1 min | Medium |
| Optimistic Rollup | 5,000 | 1s | 1 week* | Low |
| ZK Rollup | 2,000 | 1-2s | 10 min | Medium-Low |
| State Channels | 100,000+ | <1s | Instant** | Very Low |
| Sidechains | 5,000 | 2-5s | Varies | Low |

*Optimistic rollups have probabilistic finality after seconds but economic finality after the challenge period
**State channels have instant finality between parties but may require L1 for disputes
