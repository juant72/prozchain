# Scaling Layer Economics

## Overview

The economics of blockchain scaling solutions is a critical and complex aspect of ProzChain's multi-layer architecture. As transactions move across different scaling layers, economic models must ensure aligned incentives, fair value distribution, and sustainable operation while maintaining security and efficiency. This document examines the economic frameworks governing ProzChain's scaling solutions, including fee structures, token models, incentive mechanisms, and market dynamics.

Understanding the economic dimensions of scaling solutions is essential for users, developers, validators, and governance participants. Each scaling approach involves different economic trade-offs that affect cost, performance, decentralization, and user experience. ProzChain's scaling layer economics are designed to balance these considerations while providing flexibility for diverse applications.

## Economic Design Principles

### Core Economic Objectives

ProzChain's scaling economics are guided by these key objectives:

1. **Sustainability**: Ensure long-term economic viability of all scaling layers
2. **Efficiency**: Minimize transaction costs while maintaining security
3. **Fairness**: Distribute value equitably among ecosystem participants
4. **Aligned Incentives**: Reward behaviors that benefit the network
5. **Economic Security**: Make attacks economically irrational
6. **Value Capture**: Allow value created by the network to accrue appropriately
7. **User Experience**: Provide predictable, transparent economic interactions

### Value Flow Architecture
