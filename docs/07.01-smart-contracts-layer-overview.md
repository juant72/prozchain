# 1. Overview

The Smart Contracts Layer is the component of ProzChain that enables programmable logic to be deployed and executed on the blockchain. This layer serves as a deterministic computation platform that allows developers to create applications with complex business logic that can interact with blockchain state.

## Core Responsibilities

- **Contract Execution**: Processing contract calls with predictable, deterministic outcomes
- **State Management**: Providing access to persistent storage for contracts
- **Runtime Environment**: Maintaining a sandboxed execution environment for contract code
- **Code Verification**: Ensuring deployed contracts adhere to platform rules and security requirements
- **Gas Accounting**: Measuring and limiting computational resource usage

## Key Features of ProzChain's Smart Contracts Layer

ProzChain's smart contracts layer includes several distinctive features:

1. **Multi-Language Support**: Native support for multiple programming languages beyond traditional EVM languages
2. **Formal Verification**: Built-in tools for mathematical verification of contract behavior
3. **Upgradability Patterns**: First-class support for contract upgrade mechanisms
4. **Resource-Based Pricing**: Fine-grained resource accounting for fair execution pricing
5. **Cross-Contract Standardization**: Well-defined interfaces for contract interoperability

## Relation to Other Layers

The Smart Contracts Layer interacts closely with:

- **Transaction Layer**: Receives transaction calls that trigger contract execution
- **State Layer**: Reads and writes contract data to persistent storage
- **Consensus Layer**: Ensures consistent contract execution across all nodes
- **Cryptography Layer**: Uses cryptographic primitives for security operations
- **API Layer**: Exposes interfaces for external interaction with contracts

## Architecture Overview

The smart contracts layer employs a modular architecture consisting of:

```rust
/// The central orchestrator for smart contract execution
struct ContractExecutor {
    /// Virtual machine for executing contract bytecode
    vm: Box<dyn VirtualMachine>,
    
    /// Access to blockchain state
    state_manager: Arc<StateManager>,
    
    /// Contract storage handler
    storage_manager: Arc<StorageManager>,
    
    /// Gas meter for resource accounting
    gas_meter: GasMeter,
    
    /// Contract registry for metadata
    contract_registry: Arc<ContractRegistry>,
    
    /// Event manager for logs and notifications
    event_manager: Arc<EventManager>,
}

/// Virtual machine interface for executing contract code
trait VirtualMachine: Send + Sync {
    /// Execute contract code with given context
    fn execute(
        &self, 
        code: &[u8], 
        context: &ExecutionContext, 
        state: &mut dyn StateAccess
    ) -> Result<ExecutionResult, VmError>;
    
    /// Estimate gas for transaction
    fn estimate_gas(
        &self,
        code: &[u8],
        input: &[u8],
        context: &ExecutionContext
    ) -> Result<u64, VmError>;
    
    /// Validate contract bytecode
    fn validate_code(&self, code: &[u8]) -> Result<(), VmError>;
}

/// Execution context for a contract call
struct ExecutionContext {
    /// Caller of the contract
    caller: Address,
    
    /// Target contract address
    contract: Address,
    
    /// Value transferred with call
    value: Balance,
    
    /// Input data for contract call
    input: Vec<u8>,
    
    /// Gas limit for execution
    gas_limit: u64,
    
    /// Current block information
    block_info: BlockInfo,
    
    /// Call depth (for nested calls)
    call_depth: u16,
    
    /// Whether state can be modified
    is_static: bool,
}

/// Result of contract execution
struct ExecutionResult {
    /// Success (1) or failure (0) status
    status: u8,
    
    /// Gas used during execution
    gas_used: u64,
    
    /// Output data returned by contract
    return_data: Vec<u8>,
    
    /// Events emitted during execution
    events: Vec<Event>,
    
    /// State changes made by execution
    state_changes: Vec<StateChange>,
}
```

This architecture provides a flexible foundation for executing smart contracts with strong security guarantees while supporting multiple virtual machine implementations and programming languages.
