# Smart Contract Integration

This tutorial guides you through deploying and interacting with smart contracts using ProzChain's API.

## Overview

Smart contracts are self-executing programs that run on the blockchain. They allow you to create trustless applications with automated logic. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to deploy a smart contract and interact with it using ProzChain's API.

## Prerequisites

- Intermediate understanding of JavaScript/TypeScript
- Basic understanding of smart contracts and Solidity
- Node.js (v14+) installed
- A ProzChain API key (get one from the [Developer Portal](https://developer.prozchain.com))

## Project Setup

1. Create a new directory for your project:

```bash
mkdir prozchain-smartcontracts
cd prozchain-smartcontracts
npm init -y
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install @prozchain/client solc @openzeppelin/contracts dotenv
```

3. Create basic folder structure:

```bash
mkdir contracts scripts build
touch .env
```

4. Set up environment variables in `.env`:
